"Tortora, L",Beyond Discrimination: Generative AI Applications and Ethical Challenges in Forensic Psychiatry,forensic psychiatry; forensic AI; generative AI; generative artificial intelligence; discriminative AI; ethical AI; large language models; large generative AI models,"The advent and growing popularity of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) holds the potential to revolutionise AI applications in forensic psychiatry and criminal justice, which traditionally relied on discriminative AI algorithms. Generative AI models mark a significant shift from the previously prevailing paradigm through their ability to generate seemingly new realistic data and analyse and integrate a vast amount of unstructured content from different data formats. This potential extends beyond reshaping conventional practices, like risk assessment, diagnostic support, and treatment and rehabilitation plans, to creating new opportunities in previously underexplored areas, such as training and education. This paper examines the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence on AI applications in forensic psychiatry and criminal justice. First, it introduces generative AI and its prevalent models. Following this, it reviews the current applications of discriminative AI in forensic psychiatry. Subsequently, it presents a thorough exploration of the potential of generative AI to transform established practices and introduce novel applications through multimodal generative models, data generation and data augmentation. Finally, it provides a comprehensive overview of ethical and legal issues associated with deploying generative AI models, focusing on their impact on individuals as well as their broader societal implications. In conclusion, this paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse concerning the dynamic challenges of generative AI applications in forensic contexts, highlighting potential opportunities, risks, and challenges. It advocates for interdisciplinary collaboration and emphasises the necessity for thorough, responsible evaluations of generative AI models before widespread adoption into domains where decisions with substantial life-altering consequences are routinely made.",Trinity College Dublin,"Tortora, L (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Dublin, Ireland.",,2024,15,10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1346059
"Vigeant, L",Generative AI and Argument Creativity,arguments; creativity; generative AI; universal audience,"Generative AI appears to threaten argument creativity. Because of its capacity to generate coherent texts, individuals are likely to integrate its ideas, and not their own, into arguments, thereby reducing their creative contribution. This article argues that this view is mistaken-it rests on a misunderstanding of the nature of creativity. Within arguments, creative and critical thinking cannot be separated. Because creativity is enmeshed with skills such as analysis and evaluation, the use of generative AI in the construction of arguments, especially in the role as universal audience, has the potential to heighten, not diminish argument creativity.",,,,2024,44,

Significant interest in the technology has led to speculation about what fields, including visualization, can be augmented or replaced by such approaches. However, there remains a lack of understanding about which visualization activities may be particularly suitable for the application of generative AI.

Platforms, repositories, clouds, and the automation of tools and processes have been proven to improve productivity, cost, and quality. Generative AI, with its rapidly expanding capabilities, is a major step forward in this field. As a new key enabling technology, it can be used for many purposes, from creative dimensions to replacing repetitive and manual tasks. The number of opportunities increases with the capabilities of large-language models (LLMs). This has raised concerns about ethics, education, regulation, intellectual property, and even criminal activities. We analyzed the potential of generative AI and LLM technologies for future software development paths.

Generative AI, including models such as generative adversarial networks and large language models, shows promise in transforming medical diagnostics, research, treatment planning, and patient care. However, these data -intensive systems pose new threats to protected health information. This Viewpoint paper aims to explore various categories of generative AI in health care, including medical diagnostics, drug discovery, virtual health assistants, medical research, and clinical decision support, while identifying security and privacy threats within each phase of the life cycle of such systems (ie, data collection, model development, and implementation phases). The objectives of this study were to analyze the current state of generative AI in health care, identify opportunities and privacy and security challenges posed by integrating these technologies into existing health care infrastructure, and propose strategies for mitigating security and privacy risks. This study highlights the importance of addressing the security and privacy threats associated with generative AI in health care to ensure the safe and effective use of these systems. The findings of this study can inform the development of future generative AI systems in health care and help health care organizations better understand the potential benefits and risks associated with these systems. By examining the use cases and benefits of generative AI across diverse domains within health care, this paper contributes to theoretical discussions surrounding AI ethics, security vulnerabilities, and data privacy regulations.

"Bueno, CC; Chow, PS; Popowicz, A","Not what, but where is creativity?: towards a relational-materialist approach to generative AI",Creativity; Generative AI; Creative labour; Mediation; Materiality; Relationality,"The recent emergence of generative AI software as viable tools for use in the cultural and creative industries has sparked debates about the potential for creativity to be automated and augmented by algorithmic machines. Such discussions, however, begin from an ontological position, attempting to define creativity by either falling prey to universalism (i.e. creativity is X) or reductionism (i.e. only humans can be truly creative or human creativity will be fully replaced by creative machines). Furthermore, such an approach evades addressing the real and material impacts of AI on creative labour in these industries. This article thus offers more expansive methodological and conceptual approaches to the recent hype on generative AI. By combining (Csikszentmihalyi, The systems model of creativity, Springer, Dordrecht, 2014) systems view of creativity, in which we emphasise the shift from what to where is creativity, with (Lievrouw, Media technologies, The MIT Press, 2014) relational-materialist theory of mediation, we argue that the study of creativity in the context of generative AI must be attentive to the interactions between technologies, practices, and social arrangements. When exploring the relational space between these elements, three core concepts become pertinent: creative labour, automation, and distributed agency. Critiquing creativity through these conceptual lenses allows us to re-situate the use of generative AI within discourses of labour in post-industrial capitalism and brings us to a conceptualisation of creativity that privileges neither the human user nor machine algorithm but instead emphasises a relational and distributed form of agency.",University of Amsterdam,"Bueno, CC (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,2024,,10.1007/s00146-024-01921-3

It uses context-aware GPT-4 to generate tailored responses to user queries from this KB, further refined through prompt engineering and guardrails.Results Evaluated against a specialized PGx question catalog, the AI assistant showed high efficacy in addressing user queries. Compared with OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5, it demonstrated better performance, especially in provider-specific queries requiring specialized data and citations. Key areas for improvement include enhancing accuracy, relevancy, and representative language in responses.Discussion The integration of context-aware GPT-4 with RAG significantly enhanced the AI assistant's utility. RAG's ability to incorporate domain-specific CPIC data, including recent literature, proved beneficial. Challenges persist, such as the need for specialized genetic/PGx models to improve accuracy and relevancy and addressing ethical, regulatory, and safety concerns.Conclusion This study underscores generative AI's potential for transforming healthcare provider support and patient accessibility to complex pharmacogenomic information. While careful implementation of large language models like GPT-4 is necessary, it is clear that they can substantially improve understanding of pharmacogenomic data.

The field of explainable AI (XAI) seeks to make complex and opaque AI models such as neural networks more understandable to people. One approach to making generative AI models more understandable is to impose a small number of semantically meaningful attributes on generative AI models. This paper contributes a systematic examination of the impact that different combinations of variational auto-encoder models (measureVAE and adversarialVAE), configurations of latent space in the AI model (from 4 to 256 latent dimensions), and training datasets (Irish folk, Turkish folk, classical, and pop) have on music generation performance when 2 or 4 meaningful musical attributes are imposed on the generative model. To date, there have been no systematic comparisons of such models at this level of combinatorial detail. Our findings show that measureVAE has better reconstruction performance than adversarialVAE which has better musical attribute independence. Results demonstrate that measureVAE was able to generate music across music genres with interpretable musical dimensions of control, and performs best with low complexity music such as pop and rock. We recommend that a 32 or 64 latent dimensional space is optimal for 4 regularised dimensions when using measureVAE to generate music across genres.

Stiegler believes that our goal is not to abandon technology but to focus our attention on its power and direction in a hypercapitalist economy. While he did not foresee the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), its rapid acceleration raises important issues for his notion of digital writing as a pharmakon. In this essay, we examine Stiegler's view on intelligence, digital writing, technological memory, and neuropower, focusing specifically on his Shanghai lecture and Nanjing Lectures. We compare Stiegler with Catherine Malabou, who examines the nature of intelligence primarily through the lens of neuroscience. We argue that Malabou's view of neuroplasticity in human and artificial brains, and her critique of techno-narcissism in the control over technology, add an important dimension to Stiegler's political critique of education.

However, the systematic review process is a resource -intensive and time-consuming process. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a potential solution to automate tedious tasks. Objective: This study aimed to explore the feasibility of using generative AI tools to automate time-consuming and resource -intensive tasks in a systematic review process and assess the scope and limitations of using such tools. Methods: We used the design science research methodology. The solution proposed is to use cocreation with a generative AI, such as ChatGPT, to produce software code that automates the process of conducting systematic reviews. Results: A triggering prompt was generated, and assistance from the generative AI was used to guide the steps toward developing, executing, and debugging a Python script. Errors in code were solved through conversational exchange with ChatGPT, and a tentative script was created. The code pulled the mHealth solutions from the Google Play Store and searched their descriptions for keywords that hinted toward evidence base. The results were exported to a CSV file, which was compared to the initial outputs of other similar systematic review processes. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of using generative AI to automate the time-consuming process of conducting systematic reviews of mHealth apps. This approach could be particularly useful for researchers with limited coding skills.

The first concerns how we think about the training of such models-in particular, whether the creators or owners of the data that are scraped (lawfully or unlawfully, with or without permission) should be compensated for that use. The second question revolves around the ownership of the output generated by AI, which is continually improving in quality and scale. These topics fall in the realm of intellectual property, a legal framework designed to incentivize and reward only human creativity and innovation. For some years, however, Britain has maintained a distinct category for computer-generated outputs; on the input issue, the EU and Singapore have recently introduced exceptions allowing for text and data mining or computational data analysis of existing works. This article explores the broader implications of these policy choices, weighing the advantages of reducing the cost of content creation and the value of expertise against the potential risk to various careers and sectors of the economy, which might be rendered unsustainable.

While peak artwork Content Novelty, defined as focal subject matter and relations, increases over time, average Content Novelty declines, suggesting an expanding but inefficient idea space. Additionally, there is a consistent reduction in both peak and average Visual Novelty, captured by pixel-level stylistic elements.

"Griffiths, D; Frias-Martinez, E; Tlili, A; Burgos, D",A Cybernetic Perspective on Generative AI in Education: From Transmission to Coordination,Education; Cybernetics; Generative AI; Human-Machine Communication; Large Language Model (LLM); Machine Learning,"The recent sudden increase in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), and generative AI in general, has astonished education professionals and learners. In formulating a response to these developments, educational institutions are constrained by a lack of clarity concerning human -machine communication and its relationship to models of education. Ideas and models from the cybernetic tradition can help to fill this gap. Two paradigms are distinguished: (1) the transmission paradigm (combining the model of learning implied by the instruments and processes of formal education and the conduit model of communication), and (2) the coordination paradigm (combining the constructivist model of learning and the coordination model of communication). It is proposed that these paradigms have long coexisted in educational practice in a modus vivendi, which is disrupted by LLMs. If an LLM can pass an examination, then from within the transmission paradigm this can only understood as demonstrating that the LLM has indeed learned and understood the material being assessed. At the same time, we know that LLMs do not in fact have the capacity to learn and understand, but rather generate a simulacrum of intelligence. It is argued that this paradox prevents educational institutions from formulating a coherent response to generative AI systems. However, within the coordination paradigm the interactions of LLMs and education institutions can be more easily understood and can be situated in a conversational model of learning. These distinctions can help institutions, educational leaders, and teachers, to frame the complex and nuanced questions raised by GenAI, and to chart a course towards its effective use in education. More specifically, they indicate that to benefit fully from the capabilities of generative AI education institutions need to recognize the validity of the coordination paradigm and adapt their processes and instruments accordingly.",Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR),"Griffiths, D (corresponding author), Univ Int La Rioja UNIR, Res Inst Innovat & Technol Educ UNIR iTED, La Rioja, Spain.",,2024,8,10.9781/ijimai.2024.02.008

We delve into the transformative potential of GenAI in redefining educational and creative processes and challenging our existing notions of learning and creativity. Through a conversation with renowned creativity researcher Dr. Ronald Beghetto, we thematically explore how GenAI redefines educational and creative processes and challenges conventional notions of learning and creativity. Dr. Beghetto's work highlights a shift from fearing failure to embracing possibility thinking, advocating for a mindset that views creativity as a dynamic interplay of potential and adaptability. His recent work with GenAI tools illustrates their role as catalysts for possibility thinking, pushing the boundaries towards future-oriented thought and innovation. GenAI can function in multiple ways-including as a reflection of human intellect and values, and as a collaborative partner that enriches human creativity with its unpredictability and generative capabilities. We emphasize the importance of direct, critical, and creative engagement with GenAI in educational settings, cautioning against its passive or uncritical use, and advocating for a balanced approach that leverages its strengths while remaining aware of its limitations. Sharing several possibility thinking tools he has created, Dr. Beghetto offers readers a nuanced perspective on the role of GenAI in education and creativity, advocating for a future where these tools are used responsibly and creatively to unlock new possibilities and enhance human potential.",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Mishra, P (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers Coll, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",,2024,,10.1007/s11528-024-00949-y

Prior research has shown that self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies help improve novice performance in solving programming problems. However, with the advent of LLM tools like ChatGPT, novices can generate fairly accurate code by just providing the problem prompt, and hence may forego applying essential self-regulation strategies such as planning and reflection to solve the problem. In this position paper, we discuss challenges and opportunities that generative AI technologies pose for novices' self-regulation strategies in the context of programming problem solving. We believe that the key challenge facing educators is that such technologies may hamper novices' ability to regulate their programming problem solving process. On the other hand, these technologies also open up the possibility to design new interventions that promote better SRL strategies in learners. We draw on generic and domain-specific self-regulated learning theories as the basis of our work, and propose an SRL framework that incorporates use of generative AI tools in programming problem solving. We illustrate how the proposed framework guides exploration of the design space of interventions that integrate generative AI in CS education.",,"Prasad, P (corresponding author), FLAME Univ, Sch Comp & Data Sci, Pune, Maharashtra, India.",979-8-4007-0423-9,2024,,10.1145/3626252.3630828

However, despite their significance, students often grapple with the challenge of creating StandUp Reports that are clear, concise, and actionable. This paper investigates the impact of the use of generative AI in producing StandUp report recommendations, aiming to assist students in enhancing the quality and effectiveness of their reports. In a semester-long capstone course, 179 students participated in 16 real-world software development projects. They submitted weekly StandUp Reports with the assistance of an AI-powered Slack, which analyzed their initial reports and provided suggestions for enhancing them using both GPT-3.5 and the early access GPT-4 API. After each submitted report, students voluntarily answered a survey about usability and suggestion preference. Furthermore, we conducted a linguistic analysis of the recommendations made by the algorithms to gauge reading ease and comprehension complexity. Our findings indicate that the AI-based recommendation system helped students improve the overall quality of their StandUp Reports throughout the semester. Students expressed a high level of satisfaction with the tool and exhibited a strong willingness to continue using it in the future. The survey reveals that students perceived a slight improvement when using GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5. Finally, a computational linguistic analysis performed on the recommendations demonstrates that both algorithms significantly improve the alignment between the generated texts and the students' educational level, thereby improving the quality of the original texts.",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Neyem, A (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Comp Sci Dept, Santiago, Chile.",979-8-4007-0423-9,2024,,10.1145/3626252.3630854

When generative AI software such as ChatGPT generates ideas for people, they often generate false ideas. This occurrence has been called 'AI Hallucination'. It can include generating false text output that is extremely believable to completely gibberish. This source of potential misinformation has significant potential implications for the travel and tourism industry. Using survey responses from 900 consumers, this empirical study contributes to theorizing and examination of how consumers' awareness of AI Hallucination potential combines with existing concepts from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) when it comes to the decision to use generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT for tourism planning. This research also examines if the consumers are actually able to discern AI Hallucination and why they select to use AI technologies over other tourism information sources, such as aggregated peer review websites like TripAdvisor, government tourism websites, or social media influencers.

"Bown, O",Blind search and flexible product visions: the sociotechnical shaping of generative music engines,Creative AI; AI music; AI start-ups; Generative music engines,"Amidst the surge in AI-oriented commercial ventures, music is a site of intensive efforts to innovate. A number of companies are seeking to apply AI to music production and consumption, and amongst them several are seeking to reinvent the music listening experience as adaptive, interactive, functional and infinitely generative. These are bold objectives, having no clear roadmap for what designs, technologies and use cases, if any, will be successful. Thus each company relies on speculative product visions. Through four case studies of such companies, I consider how product visions must carefully provide a clear plan for developers and investors, whilst also remaining open to agile user-centred product development strategies, which I discuss in terms of the 'blind search' nature of innovation. I suggest that innovation in this area needs to be understood in terms of technological emergence, which is neither technologically determinist nor driven entirely by the visions of founders, but through a complex of interacting forces. I also consider, through these cases, how, through the accumulation of residual value, all such start-up work risks being exapted for more familiar extractive capitalist agendas under the general process that Doctorow calls enshittification.

With all its subfields, International Relations (IR) has gone through numerous turns, especially during the last two decades which made encounters poised to change the nature of foreign policy-such as new actors, ideas, or technologies-a familiar experience. While these discussions enriched the discipline of IR, hardly any of these turns lived up to their promises. Certainly, we have an increasingly challenging and complex multipolar world ahead of us. This manifests that a broader network of actors, interests, and technologies needs to be considered. AI, indeed, has the potential capacity to assist and disrupt the ways diplomacy works. Yet heralding an anticipatory practice and study of diplomacy based on AI's socio-technical imaginaries and calculations rather than as a participatory process centered on immediate human interaction, resources, intelligence, and rapport bears the potential of obscuring the analytical clarity needed.

Recently, the emergence and rapid adoption of advanced large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT, Google's PaLM, and Meta's Llama have shown great potential and sparked considerable global interest. However, the current surge lacks a study investigating the opportunities and challenges of implementing Generative AI (GenAI) in the construction sector, creating a critical knowledge gap for researchers and practitioners. This underlines the necessity to explore the prospects and complexities of GenAI integration. Bridging this gap is fundamental to optimizing GenAI's early stage adoption within the construction sector. Given GenAI's unprecedented capabilities to generate human-like content based on learning from existing content, we reflect on two guiding questions: What will the future bring for GenAI in the construction industry?

A comparative vision between American and European Union Copyright Laws.,Artificial Intelligence; Generative AI; US copyright; European copyright; authorship,"This paper addresses the question of whether generative AI can create copyrightable works by making a comparative analysis between European Union law and U.S. copyright law. First, it is argued that for copyright law it does not seem possible for an entity other than a human being to be the copyright holder, thus ruling out the possibility of generative AI being considered a copyright holder. It is established that in US copyright the door it may be possible to register part of a work made using generative AI, and that in the EU this door remains open and pending evolution, although European jurisprudence already gives some guidelines. Afterwards, this paper explores possible infringement of exploitation rights in the different parts of the training process of generative AI models and in the activities that lead to the generation of content that is like intellectual works. It is concluded that in US law there is a gap in knowledge as to whether fair use would cover these types of activities. In European Law, although there are exceptions such as those in Directive 2001/29, it is not at all clear whether this will be sufficient to cover these activities, or whether the authorization of the rights owner will be necessary. If the latter is true and judging by the wave of lawsuits that have followed against companies and institutions that have made generative AI tools publicly available, it is possible that licensing negotiation may take a central role in the AI industry, with the negative consequences that this may bring for the advancement of science and for the public domain.",Pompeu Fabra University,"Presuel, RC (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona Sch Management, Barcelona, Spain.",,2024,27,10.4114/intartif.vol27iss73pp14-37

Specifically, we aim to assess whether ChatGPT can demonstrate clinical decision-making equivalent to that of expert nurses and novice nursing students. This will be evaluated by comparing ChatGPT responses to clinical scenarios to those of nurses on different levels of experience. Design: This is a cross-sectional study. Methods: Emergency room registered nurses (i.e. experts; n = 30) and nursing students (i.e. novices; n = 38) were recruited during March-April 2023. Clinical decision-making was measured using three validated clinical scenarios involving an initial assessment and reevaluation. Clinical decision-making aspects assessed were the accuracy of initial assessments, the appropriateness of recommended tests and resource use and the capacity to reevaluate decisions. Performance was also compared by timing response generations and word counts. Expert nurses and novice students completed online questionnaires (via Qualtrics), while ChatGPT responses were obtained from OpenAI. Results: Concerning aspects of clinical decision-making and compared to novices and experts: (1) ChatGPT exhibited indecisiveness in initial assessments; (2) ChatGPT tended to suggest unnecessary diagnostic tests; (3) When new information required re-evaluation, ChatGPT responses demonstrated inaccurate understanding and inappropriate modifications. In terms of performance, the mean number of words utilized in ChatGPT answers was 27-41 times greater than that utilized by both experts and novices; and responses were provided approximately 4 times faster than those of novices and twice faster than expert nurses. ChatGPT responses maintained logical structure and clarity. Conclusions: A generative AI tool demonstrated indecisiveness and a tendency towards over-triage compared to human clinicians.

For that, we analyzed the computational resources of AI- and human-generated program code using metrics such as time and space complexity as well as runtime and memory usage. Additionally, we evaluated the maintainability using metrics such as lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, Halstead complexity and maintainability index. For our experiments, we had generative AIs produce program code in Java, Python, and C++ that solves problems defined on the competition coding website leetcode.com. We selected six LeetCode problems of varying difficulty, resulting in 18 program codes generated by each generative AI. GitHub Copilot, powered by Codex (GPT-3.0), performed best, solving 9 of the 18 problems (50.0%), whereas CodeWhisperer did not solve a single problem. BingAI Chat (GPT-4.0) generated correct program code for seven problems (38.9%), ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) and Code Llama (Llama 2) for four problems (22.2%) and StarCoder and InstructCodeT5+ for only one problem (5.6%). Surprisingly, although ChatGPT generated only four correct program codes, it was the only generative AI capable of providing a correct solution to a coding problem of difficulty level hard. In summary, 26 AI-generated codes (20.6%) solve the respective problem. For 11 AI-generated incorrect codes (8.7%), only minimal modifications to the program code are necessary to solve the problem, which results in time savings between 8.9% and even 71.3% in comparison to programming the program code from scratch.",International University of Applied Sciences - Germany,"Schlippe, T (corresponding author), IU Int Univ Appl Sci, D-99084 Erfurt, Germany.",,2024,17,10.3390/a17020062
"Li, R",Weaving tales of resilience: cyborg composing with AI,Found poetry; Cyborg composing; Collaborative writing; Generative AI,"Purpose - This paper aims to offer an approach to cyborg composing with artificial intelligence (AI). The author posits that the hybridity of the cyborg, which amalgamates human and artificial elements, invites a cascade of creative and emancipatory possibilities. The author critically examines the biases embedded in AI systems while gesturing toward the generative potential of AI-human entanglements. Drawing on Bakhtinian theories of dialogism, the author contends that crafting found poetry with AI could inspire writers to problematize the ideologies embedded into the corpus while teasing apart its elisions or contradictions, sparking new forms of expression at the interface of the organic and the artificial. Design/methodology/approach - To illustrate this approach to human-AI composing, the author shares a found poem that she wrote using ChatGPT alongside her reflection on the poem. The author reflects on her positionality as well as the positionality of her artificial interlocutor, interrogating the notion of subjectivity in relation to Bakhtinian dialogism and multivocality. Findings - Weaving tales of resilience in harmony or tension with AI could unravel threads of possibility as human writers enrich, deepen or complicate AI-generated texts. By composing with AI, writers can resist closure, infiltrate illusions of objectivity and speak back to AI and the dominant voices replicated in its systems. Originality/value - By encouraging students to critically engage with, question and complicate AI-generated texts, one can open avenues for alternative ways of thinking and writing, inspiring students to imagine and compose speculative futures.

While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are the most common network type for image generation tasks, recent studies have only focused on RGB-to-RGB domain transfer tasks. This study utilises a state-of-the-art GAN network for domain transfer that effectively transforms a multi-channel image from a 3D scene into a photorealistic image. It relies on a custom dataset that pairs 360(degrees) images from a simulated domain with corresponding 360(degrees) street views. The simulated domain includes depth, segmentation map, and surface normal (stored in seven-channel images), while the target domain is composed of photos from Paris. Samples come in pairs thanks to careful virtual camera positioning. To enhance the simulated images into photorealistic views, the generator is designed to preserve semantic information throughout the layers. The study concludes with photorealistic-generated samples from the city of Paris, along with strategies to further refine model performance.

However, it is also well-known that such models often hallucinate, leading to false findings in the generated reports. In this paper, we propose a new method of fact-checking of AI-generated reports using their associated images. Specifically, the developed examiner differentiates real and fake sentences in reports by learning the association between an image and sentences describing real or potentially fake findings. To train such an examiner, we first created a new dataset of fake reports by perturbing the findings in the original ground truth radiology reports associated with images. Text encodings of real and fake sentences drawn from these reports are then paired with image encodings to learn the mapping to real/fake labels.

It involves the arrangement and design of street systems, groups of buildings, public spaces, and landscapes, to make the urban environment performative and sustainable. The typical design process, reliant on manual work and expert experience has unavoidable low efficiency in generating high-performing design solutions due to the involvement of complex social, institutional, and economic contexts and the trade-off between conflicting preferences of different stakeholder groups. Taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) and computational capacity, generative urban design (GUD) has been developed as a trending technical direction to narrow the gaps and produce design solutions with high efficiency at early design stages. It uses computer-aided generative methods, such as evolutionary optimization and deep generative models, to efficiently explore complex solution spaces and automatically generate design options that satisfy conflicting objectives and various constraints. GUD experiments have attracted much attention from academia, practitioners, and public authorities in recent years. However, a systematic review of the current stage of GUD research is lacking. This study, therefore, reports on a systematic investigation of the existing literature according to the three key stages in the GUD process: (1) design problem formulation, (2) design option generation, and (3) decision-making. For each stage, current trends, findings, and limitations from GUD studies are examined. Future directions and potential challenges are discussed and presented. The review is highly interdisciplinary and involves articles from urban study, computer science, social science, management, and other fields.

Moving beyond patterns and purposes of use, future inclusive and co-designed research with this population should (a) include social media data, whether independently or co-produced with supporters; (b) explore the under-researched legal, ethical, and safety issues; (c) measure the outcomes and impact of social media publication in relation to the user or user group's emancipation, education, and enablement; and (d) consider the impact of GenAI on social media use for this group.SummaryContinued attention to the safe and enjoyable use of social media for all those who wish to use it, and foundational research on the uptake and use of GenAI, will be important to understand and support the advanced communication technology support needs of people with developmental communication disability. To inform future advances in both social media and GenAI for populations with developmental communication disability, future research directions are proposed.",University of Technology Sydney; Western Sydney University,"Hemsley, B (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Ultimo, Australia.",,2024,,10.1007/s40474-024-00297-9

"Alavi, M; Leidner, DE; Mousavi, R",A Knowledge Management Perspective of Generative Artificial Intelligence,Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI); Knowledge Management; Knowledge Workers; Organizational Learning; AI-Driven Innovation; Ethical Implications of AI; GenAI Integration in Organizations,"In this editorial, revisiting Alavi and Leidner (2001) as a conceptual lens, we consider the organizational implications of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) from a knowledge management (KM) perspective. We examine how GenAI impacts the processes of knowledge creation, storage, transfer, and application, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges this technology presents. In knowledge creation, GenAI enhances information processing and cognitive functions, fostering individual and organizational learning. However, it also introduces risks like AI bias and reduced human socialization, potentially marginalizing junior knowledge workers. For knowledge storage and retrieval, GenAI's ability to quickly access vast knowledge bases significantly changes employee interactions with KM systems. This raises questions about balancing human-derived tacit knowledge with AI-generated explicit knowledge. The paper also explores GenAI's role in knowledge transfer, particularly in training and cultivating a learning culture. Challenges include an overreliance on AI and risks in disseminating sensitive information. In terms of knowledge application, GenAI is seen as a tool to boost productivity and innovation, but issues like knowledge misapplication, intellectual property, and ethical considerations are critical. Conclusively, the paper argues for a balanced approach to integrating GenAI into KM processes. It advocates for harmonizing GenAI's capabilities with human insights to effectively manage knowledge in contemporary organizations, ensuring both technological advances and ethical responsibility.",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of Virginia,"Alavi, M (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Scheller Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA.",,2024,25,10.17705/1jais.00859

The former involves the mathematics behind AI constructs, as well as new AI research; the latter encompasses the substance of AI use, i.e., programming, training, execution, etc. With the recent proliferation of Large Language Models for content generation, such as texts, images, and videos, there arises a new context of AI use: practical. This aspect of AI use is unique, in that practical users do not need theoretical or technical AI knowledge to prosper: they need only know how to prompt. In effect, the practical context of AI use is a black-box approach. These three contexts of AI converge in a unique intersection of AI knowledge.

We share our unexpected encounter with AI during our story completion study on mobile dating during the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss how we identified AI responses within our dataset. Central to our analysis was our theoretical grounding of feminist new materialism, which attuned us to the affective and discursive qualities of our participant data. Using our theoretical lens, in tandem with other strategies, we examined the affective forces that signalled stark differences between previous, human-generated data and that of the current study. Analysing the discursive construction of narratives further alerted us to the absence of humans within our data.

AI technologies and the needs of data librarians are hybrid and symbiotic, because academic libraries must insert AI technologies into their information and data services. Library services need AI to interpret the context of big data. OBJECTIVES: In this context, we explore the use of the OpenAI Codex, a deep learning model trained on Python code from repositories, to generate code scripts for data librarians. This investigation examines the practices, models, and methodologies for obtaining code script insights from complex code environments linked to AI GPT technologies. METHODS: The proposed AI-powered method aims to assist data librarians in creating code scripts using Python libraries and plugins such as the integrated development environment PyCharm, with additional support from the Machinet AI and Bito AI plugins. The process involves collaboration between the data librarian and the AI agent, with the librarian providing a natural language description of the programming problem and the OpenAI Codex generating the solution code in Python.RESULTS: Five specific web-scraping problems are presented. The scripts demonstrate how to extract data, calculate metrics, and write the results to files. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study highlights the application of AI in assisting data librarians with code script creation for web scraping tasks. AI may be a valuable resource for data librarians dealing with big data challenges on the Web. The possibility of creating Python code with AI is of great value, as AI technologies can help data librarians work with various types of data sources. The Python code in Data Science web scraping projects uses a machine-learning model that can generate human-like code to help create and improve the library service for extracting data from a web collection. The ability of nonprogramming data librarians to use AI technologies facilitates their interactions with all types and data sources.

This cognitive ability enhances their grasp of the content and augments their overall enjoyment. Consequently, the development of an automated system aimed at producing visually faithful images based on textual descriptions, often referred to as the text-to-image task, stands as a profoundly meaningful endeavor.

Nevertheless, the generative AIs introduced thus far encounter an issue wherein they struggle to uphold the coherence of input sentences, particularly when multiple sentences are provided. Within this paper, we present a remedy to this challenge through the application of prompt editing. Furthermore, our experimental results substantiate that our proposed solution more effectively preserves contextual coherence among the generated images in comparison to other preexisting generative artificial intelligence models.

The proposed GAN-based architecture efficiently provides accurate footstep planning design for TurtleBot4 on the ROS (Robot Operating System) platform. The designed robot's perception of its surroundings allows it to generate a precise path for navigation during travel. Even though various algorithms, such as A* and RRT* (rapidly exploring random tree), are often employed to plan the path, they need more efficiency in confined spaces. However, deep learning approaches such as GANs have shown remarkable results in solving real-world issues such as image generation and simulation of difficult scenarios in robotics. This article proposes a mechanism to design the GAN algorithm for path generation, thus facilitating the efficient navigation of wheeled robots in complex environments such as narrow streets. According to the experiments, the approach based on GAN works better than traditional algorithms such as heuristic Q-Learning and A*.

Despite its utility, it can be difficult to implement effectively, particularly for younger learners, who are often novices at providing feedback. It can be difficult for students to learn what constitutes '' good '' feedback - particularly in openended problem-solving contexts. To address this gap, we investigate both classical natural language processing techniques and large language models, specifically ChatGPT, as potential approaches to devise an automated detector of feedback quality (including both student progress towards goals and next steps needed). Our findings indicate that the classical detectors are highly accurate and, through feature analysis, we elucidate the pivotal elements influencing its decision process.

Despite being the most common preventable risk factor for all -cause mortality, only a fraction of affected individuals maintain their blood pressure in the desired range. In recent times, there has been a growing reliance on online platforms for medical information. While providing a convenient source of information, differentiating reliable from unreliable information can be daunting for the layperson, and false information can potentially hinder timely diagnosis and management of medical conditions. The surge in accessibility of generative artificial intelligence (GeAI) technology has led to increased use in obtaining health -related information. This has sparked debates among healthcare providers about the potential for misuse and misinformation while recognizing the role of GeAI in improving health literacy. This study aims to investigate the accuracy of AI -generated information specifically related to hypertension. Additionally, it seeks to explore the reproducibility of information provided by GeAI. Method A nonhuman -subject qualitative study was devised to evaluate the accuracy of information provided by ChatGPT regarding hypertension and its secondary complications. Frequently asked questions on hypertension were compiled by three study staff, internal medicine residents at an ACGME-accredited program, and then reviewed by a physician experienced in treating hypertension, resulting in a final set of 100 questions. Each question was posed to ChatGPT three times, once by each study staff, and the majority response was then assessed against the recommended guidelines. A board -certified internal medicine physician with over eight years of experience further reviewed the responses and categorized them into two classes based on their clinical appropriateness: appropriate (in line with clinical recommendations) and inappropriate (containing errors). Descriptive statistical analysis was employed to assess ChatGPT responses for accuracy and reproducibility. Result Initially, a pool of 130 questions was gathered, of which a final set of 100 questions was selected for the purpose of this study. When assessed against acceptable standard responses, ChatGPT responses were found to be appropriate in 92.5% of cases and inappropriate in 7.5%. Furthermore, ChatGPT had a reproducibility score of 93%, meaning that it could consistently reproduce answers that conveyed similar meanings across multiple runs. Conclusion ChatGPT showcased commendable accuracy in addressing commonly asked questions about hypertension. These results underscore the potential of GeAI in providing valuable information to patients.

To address this issue, we propose a Global and Local Feature Fusion (GLFF) framework to learn rich and discriminative representations by combining multi-scale global features from the whole image with refined local features from informative patches for AI-synthesized image detection. GLFF fuses information from two branches: the global branch to extract multi-scale semantic features and the local branch to select informative patches for detailed local artifacts extraction. Due to the lack of a synthesized image dataset simulating real-world applications for evaluation, we further create a challenging fake image dataset, named DeepFakeFaceForensics (DF3), which contains 6 state-of-the-art generation models and a variety of post-processing techniques to approach the real-world scenarios.

Initially, a synthetic dataset is generated that mirrors the ten classes of the already available CIFAR-10 dataset with latent diffusion, providing a contrasting set of images for comparison to real photographs. The model is capable of generating complex visual attributes, such as photorealistic reflections in water. The two sets of data present as a binary classification problem with regard to whether the photograph is real or generated by AI.

Our analysis is structured around four pivotal themes: the debates on plagiarism and authorship in AI-generated content; the underlying power dynamics that shape biases in AI development; the dynamic, complex relationships between humans and machines; and the growing concerns over unchecked progress and the absence of accountability in the rapidly intensifying AI Arms Race. Recognizing the necessity for ethical alignment in AI, yet without a clear consensus of human interests, gives room for further exacerbating global inequalities, we advocate for enhanced transparency and increased public involvement in AI development and deployment processes. This article underscores the importance of engaging a diverse range of voices, especially those from communities traditionally uninvolved or excluded from the dialogue on AI development.

To harness this transformation, we need to understand the limitations of LLMs. Here, we investigate the bias of AIGC produced by seven representative LLMs, including ChatGPT and LLaMA. We collect news articles from The New York Times and Reuters, both known for their dedication to provide unbiased news. We then apply each examined LLM to generate news content with headlines of these news articles as prompts, and evaluate the gender and racial biases of the AIGC produced by the LLM by comparing the AIGC and the original news articles. We further analyze the gender bias of each LLM under biased prompts by adding gender-biased messages to prompts constructed from these news headlines. Our study reveals that the AIGC produced by each examined LLM demonstrates substantial gender and racial biases. Moreover, the AIGC generated by each LLM exhibits notable discrimination against females and individuals of the Black race. Among the LLMs, the AIGC generated by ChatGPT demonstrates the lowest level of bias, and ChatGPT is the sole model capable of declining content generation when provided with biased prompts.","University of Delaware; Tsinghua University; The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics","Fang, X (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Newark, NJ 19716 USA.;Che, SK (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,2024,14,10.1038/s41598-024-55686-2

Only images directly produced by cameras are deemed unaltered and beyond suspicion, as they have not undergone any modifications. However, there is a recent trend among camera manufacturers to integrate AI-based modules into the dedicated onboard hardware, specifically the image signal processor (ISP), responsible for processing the captured sensor image into the final saved image for users. Many of these AI modules utilize perceptual or generative losses during training, which can hallucinate image content. While this hallucinated content often manifests as small details and textures, there are instances where these regions unintentionally impact the interpretation of the entire image. This paper aims to bring attention to this issue and advocate for in-camera strategies to validate the authenticity of camera-captured images at a pixel level. We propose the creation of an authenticity mask that could be stored as additional metadata with each image. This information can be extracted and overlaid on the image to easily identify the hallucinated regions. Considering the widespread implications of image authenticity (e.g., in courtroom evidence, news broadcasts, and other media forms), we anticipate that authentication metadata will become a standard practice for any ISP utilizing AI.",,"Punnappurath, A (corresponding author), Samsung AI Ctr Toronto, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada.",,2024,12,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3381521

Drawing on Bacchi's 'What's the problem represented to be' (WPR) framework, we analysed the GenAI policies of 20 world-leading universities to explore what are considered problems in this AI-mediated assessment landscape and how these problems are represented in policies. Although miscellaneous GenAI-related problems were mentioned in these policies (e.g. reliability of AI-generated outputs, equal access to GenAI), the primary problem represented is that students may not submit original work for assessment. In the current framing, GenAI is often viewed as a type of external assistance separate from the student's independent efforts and intellectual contribution, thereby undermining the originality of their work. We argue that such problem representation fails to acknowledge how the rise of GenAI further complicates the process of producing original work and what it means by originality in a time when knowledge production becomes increasingly distributed, collaborative and mediated by technology. Therefore, a critical silence in higher education policies concerns the evolving notion of originality in the digital age and a more inclusive approach to address the originality of students' work is required.",Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK),"Luo, JH (corresponding author), Educ Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ & Human Dev, Ctr Higher Educ Leadership & Policy Studies, Dept Educ Policy & Leadership, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,2024,,10.1080/02602938.2024.2309963

However, getting high resolution multi-faceted data about a city has been a challenge. Further, even when the data were available the integration into a model is even more of a challenge due to the parametric needs, and the data volumes. Further, even if this is achieved, the cities themselves continually evolve rendering the data obsolete, thus necessitating a fast and repeatable data capture mechanism. We have shown that by using AI/graphics community advances we can create a seamless opportunity for high resolution models. Instead of assuming every physical and behavioral detail is sensed, a generative and procedural approach seeks to computationally infer a fully detailed 3D fit-for-purpose model of an urban space. We present a perspective building on recent success results of this generative approach applied to urban design and planning at different scales, for different components of the urban landscape, and related applications.

Overcoming this challenge requires integrating domain knowledge and nuances of the built environment to enhance context-awareness in automated site planning. This study therefore proposes the context-aware site planning generative adversarial networks (CAIN-GAN) framework. In the case study of New York City (NYC), CAIN-GAN demonstrates its capability to not only synthesize visually realistic and semantically reasonable design solutions, but also evaluate their performance in urban sustainability for informed decisionmaking. This context-aware, learning-based, data-driven, and user-guided generation process signifies a pivotal advancement in more performative and tailored design solutions.

One particular example of such a tool is ChatGPT which is the first and world's most popular multipurpose generative AI tool. This study aims to put forward a policy-making framework of generative artificial intelligence based on the risk, reward, and resilience framework. A systematic search was conducted, by using carefully chosen keywords, excluding non-English content, conference articles, book chapters, and editorials. Published research were filtered based on their relevance to ChatGPT ethics, yielding a total of 41 articles. Key elements surrounding ChatGPT concerns and motivations were systematically deduced and classified under the risk, reward, and resilience categories to serve as ingredients for the proposed decision-making framework. The decisionmaking process and rules were developed as a primer to help policymakers navigate decision-making conundrums. Then, the framework was practically tailored towards some of the concerns surrounding ChatGPT in the context of higher education. In the case of the interconnection between risk and reward, the findings show that providing students with access to ChatGPT presents an opportunity for increased efficiency in tasks such as text summarization and workload reduction. However, this exposes them to risks such as plagiarism and cheating. Similarly, pursuing certain opportunities such as accessing vast amounts of information, can lead to rewards, but it also introduces risks like misinformation and copyright issues. Likewise, focusing on specific capabilities of ChatGPT, such as developing tools to detect plagiarism and misinformation, may enhance resilience in some areas (e.g., academic integrity). However, it may also create vulnerabilities in other domains, such as the digital divide, educational equity, and job losses. Furthermore, the finding indicates secondorder effects of legislation regarding ChatGPT which have implications both positively and negatively. One potential effect is a decrease in rewards due to the limitations imposed by the legislation, which may hinder individuals from fully capitalizing on the opportunities provided by ChatGPT. Hence, the risk, reward, and resilience framework provides a comprehensive and flexible decision-making model that allows policymakers and in this use case, higher education institutions to navigate the complexities and trade-offs associated with ChatGPT, which have theoretical and practical implications for the future.",Multimedia University,"Sayeed, MS (corresponding author), Multimedia Univ, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, Ctr Intelligent Cloud Comp CICC, Melaka, Malaysia.",,2024,10,10.7717/peerj-cs.1845

The survey of academics' perceptions encompasses considerations of academic integrity, transferrable skills, and ethical GAI use. The responses unveiled a range of significant findings regarding the present condition of essay-based assessment in Economics education. The most prominent of which is that, while GAI development has introduced a new conflict between integrity concerns and essay-writing, Economics academics confirm that the latter continues to be important to their graduates. However, there is an emphasis on reshaping the format of conventional essays and refining traditional marking criteria. Elevating assessment questions along Bloom's taxonomy is deemed vital for critical thinking and producing futureready graduates. Respondents also recognise the need to impart ethical awareness among students when using GAI while exploring innovative pedagogies to develop and assess the new GAI skill set. Thus, our study challenges the dichotomy of pulling the plug on conventional essays and, instead, prompts a critical re-evaluation-resuscitation through reimagination. Finally, most express interest in learning more about GAI and its educational applications, either through selfexperimentation or structured events and GAI training.

Most existing explainable RL models focus on improving the explainability of an agent's observations instead of the relationships between agent states and actions. This study presents a fuzzy centered explainable network (FCEN) for RL tasks to interpret the relationships between agent states and actions. The proposed FCEN leverages the interpretability of fuzzy neural networks to establish if-then rules and a generative model to visualize learned knowledge. Precisely, the FCEN includes if-then rules that formulate state-action mappings with human-understandable logic, such as the form IF Input is A THEN Output is B. In addition, these rules connect with a generative model that concretizes the states into human-understandable patterns (figures). Our experimental results obtained on 4 Atari games show that the proposed FCEN can achieve a high level of performance in RL tasks and enormously boost the explainability of RL agents both globally and locally. In other words, the FCEN maintains a high-level explanation for the agent decision logic and the possibility of low-level analysis for each given observation sample. The explainability boost does not undermine reward learning performance, humans can even enhance the agent's performance with the provided explainability.",University of Technology Sydney,"Ou, L (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Australian AI Inst, GrapheneX UTS Human Centr AI Ctr, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",,2024,32,10.1109/TFUZZ.2023.3295055

Recently, text generated by large language models (LLMs) has been used to create open-ended text-based game content. However, LLMs have been shown to generate sexist text when trained on gender-biased data. If bias manifests in educational text game affordances it could harm goal achievement. We examine binary gender biases in LIGHT, an English-language persona-based dataset for researching language grounded in a fantasy adventure world, training LLMs on LIGHT and analyzing the diversity of affordances in quests. We find male characters have a more diverse space of affordances yet are less diverse in practice (e.g., mostly wielding a sword) in original and generated quests. To gauge impact on gameplay, we create games from LIGHT quests which can be played in the TextWorld research framework.

While traditional models achieved modest performance, with test accuracies ranging from 43% to 77% and 49% to 73% requiring lengthy training times, the suggested model performed exceptionally well, obtaining test accuracies of 99.77% and 95.37% for CT and X-ray, respectively with a short training duration of 10-12 and 40-42 seconds/epoch. Robustness is demonstrated through the progressive reduction of the number of training images, with findings indicating that the model maintains good performance even on a reduced dataset. An explainable AI technique Grad-CAM is used to explain the model's judgment. Grad-CAM-based color visualization is shown to explain model assessments and help health specialists make quick, confident decisions.

"Ishizue, R; Sakamoto, K; Washizaki, H; Fukazawa, Y",Improved Program Repair Methods using Refactoring with GPT Models,Programming Assignment; Program Repair; Generative AI,"Teachers often utilize automatic program repair methods to provide feedback on submitted student code using model answer code. A state-of-the-art tool is Refactory, which achieves a high repair success rate and small patch size (less code repair) by refactoring code to expand the variety of correct code samples that can be referenced. However, Refactory has two major limitations. First, it cannot fix code with syntax errors. Second, it has difficulty fixing code when there are few correct submissions. Herein we propose a new method that combines Refactory and OpenAI's GPT models to address these issues and conduct a performance measurement experiment. The experiment uses a dataset consisting of 5 programming assignment problems and almost 1,800 real-life incorrect Python program submissions from 361 students for an introductory programming course at a large public university. The proposed method improves the repair success rate by 1-21% when the set of correct code samples is sufficient and the patch size is smaller than Refactory alone in 16-45% of the cases. When there was no set of correct code samples at all (only the model answer code was used as a reference for repair), method improves the repair success rate by 1-43% and the patch size is smaller than Refactory alone in 42-68% of the cases.",Waseda University,"Ishizue, R (corresponding author), Waseda Univ, Tokyo, Japan.;Ishizue, R (corresponding author), NTT DATA Grp Corp, Tokyo, Japan.",979-8-4007-0423-9,2024,,10.1145/3626252.3630875

It also examines the faculty's readiness to cope with the challenges and leverage the opportunities presented by AI-powered conversational models. Background Launched on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT took the world by storm with its capability to generate high-quality written expressions in a conversational manner. The reactions to this innovation varied, from enthusiasm regarding its potential to enrich students' learning to concerns about its threat to students' cognitive development and academic integrity. A systematic exploration of students' and faculty's KAP towards ChatGPT can play an important role in addressing the multifaceted dimensions of AI-driven conversational models. naires distributed to 145 faculty members, as well as 855 undergraduate and graduate students at the ESPRIT School of Engineering and School of Busi- ness. The student sample was based on stratified and convenience sampling, while the faculty sample was based on a consensus sampling approach. Contribution To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported study that contributes to understanding the KAP of students and faculty towards ChatGPT, as well as the readiness of faculty to effectively adopt AI -driven conversational models. Furthermore, our research contributes to the body of knowledge by taking Vygotsky's (1978) principle of social interaction and its role in promoting cogni- tive development to a new level by hypothesizing that if students were to ac- quire the competencies to actively engage with AI -driven chatbots in meaning- ful discussions and collaborative conversations, they might be able to develop some higher -order thinking skills further. Findings Our results indicated that faculty demonstrated a higher level of ChatGPT knowledge than students and that more than 40% of surveyed students and fac- ulty expressed some trust in the reliability of ChatGPT's responses, a perception that does not align with reality. Faculty attitude towards ChatGPT was compar- atively more reserved compared to that of students and showcased varying opinions. Furthermore, the surveyed faculty showcased a more negative percep- tion of ChatGPT than students, and they expressed a greater degree of skepti- cism. Our research revealed that 63.4% of surveyed faculty reported that they lack the requisite training and resources to integrate ChatGPT into their peda- gogical practices. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers HEIs should take appropriate measures to enhance students' and faculty's knowledge, attitude, and perception regarding ChatGPT to stimulate ethical, meaningful, innovative, and engaging interactions and learning experiences. Our study has shed light on some moderating factors that shape the acceptance of AI -driven conversational models and some adoption barriers. It delves into the perceptions, biases, and misconceptions held by both students and faculty, thereby providing a basis for future investigations on the effective integration of AI -driven conversational models in higher education. Impact on Society This research provides new insights that can harness the potential merits of ChatGPT in enhancing students' learning while mitigating potential pitfalls. It suggests facilitating open forums and dialogues among students, faculty, em- ployers, and other key stakeholders to debate the impact of AI -driven conversa- tional models on students' learning and faculty's teaching and assessment. Future Research We invite researchers to conduct cross-cultural studies on this topic while also taking into consideration a qualitative research design approach.

They are transformer-based deep learning architectures, obtained through the scaling of model size, pretraining of corpora, and computational resources. The potential healthcare applications of these models primarily involve chatbots and interaction systems for clinical documentation management, and medical literature summarization (Biomedical NLP). The challenge in this field lies in the research for applications in diagnostic and clinical decision support, as well as patient triage. Therefore, LLMs can be used for multiple tasks within patient care, research, and education. Throughout 2023, there has been an escalation in the release of LLMs, some of which are applicable in the healthcare domain. This remarkable output is largely the effect of the customization of pre-trained models for applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, or any system requiring human-like conversational engagement. As healthcare professionals, we recognize the imperative to stay at the forefront of knowledge. However, keeping abreast of the rapid evolution of this technology is practically unattainable, and, above all, understanding its potential applications and limitations remains a subject of ongoing debate. Consequently, this article aims to provide a succinct overview of the recently released LLMs, emphasizing their potential use in the field of medicine. Perspectives for a more extensive range of safe and effective applications are also discussed. The upcoming evolutionary leap involves the transition from an AI-powered model primarily designed for answering medical questions to a more versatile and practical tool for healthcare providers such as generalist biomedical AI systems for multimodal-based calibrated decision-making processes.

We introduce the term 'machinic gaze' to conceptualise the reconfiguration of heritage representation via artificial intelligence (AI) models. To explore how this gaze reframes heritage, we deploy an image-text-image pipeline that reads, interprets, and resynthesizes images of several UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

Early detection is essential to reduce the impact of a condition, and artificial intelligence (AI) and chatbots provide new opportunities to enhance diagnosis. This study evaluates the effectiveness of integrating a chatbot with ChatGPT version GPT-3.5 for the preliminary diagnosis of dengue and its contribution to timely detection. To evaluate this, two types of tests were conducted using a dataset of 30 dengue cases. In the first test, the chatbot was evaluated without being trained with dengue symptoms. In the second test, however, the model was trained using dengue symptoms obtained from official websites such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The performance of the chatbot was evaluated using the confusion matrix, performance metrics, and user satisfaction. The results of the second test showed impressive performance, with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 100%. This surpassed the first test, which achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 83%, 80%, and 90%, respectively. In addition, 15 users reported positive satisfaction, with an overall average rating of 4.25 out of 5.

Generated gaze data shows situation-dependent modulations,personality traits; Big Five; gaze behavior; eye and head movements; generative AI; generative adversarial networks; behavior generation; disentanglement,"It has both scientific and practical benefits to substantiate the theoretical prediction that personality (Big Five) traits systematically modulate gaze behavior in various real-world (working) situations. Nevertheless, previous methods that required controlled situations and large numbers of participants failed to incorporate real-world personality modulation analysis. One cause of this research gap is the mixed effects of individual attributes (e.g., the accumulated attributes of age, gender, and degree of measurement noise) and personality traits in gaze data. Previous studies may have used larger sample sizes to average out the possible concentration of specific individual attributes in some personality traits, and may have imposed control situations to prevent unexpected interactions between these possibly biased individual attributes and complex, realistic situations. Therefore, we generated and analyzed real-world gaze behavior where the effects of personality traits are separated out from individual attributes. In Experiment 1, we successfully provided a methodology for generating such sensor data on head and eye movements for a small sample of participants who performed realistic nonsocial (data-entry) and social (conversation) work tasks (i.e., the first contribution). In Experiment 2, we evaluated the effectiveness of generated gaze behavior for real-world personality modulation analysis. We successfully showed how openness systematically modulates the autocorrelation coefficients of sensor data, reflecting the period of head and eye movements in data-entry and conversation tasks (i.e., the second contribution). We found different openness modulations in the autocorrelation coefficients from the generated sensor data of the two tasks. These modulations could not be detected using real sensor data because of the contamination of individual attributes.

However, the intricate domain knowledge and the unique software paradigms inherent to the manufacturing sector have posed significant barriers to the effective utilization of LLM. To address this divide, an error-assisted fine-tuning approach is proposed to adapt LLM specifically for the manufacturing domain. Initially, the LLM is fine-tuned using a manufacturing-domain corpus, allowing it to learn and adapt to the nuances of the manufacturing field. Additionally, the injection of a labeled dataset into a pre-configured LLM enhances its ability to identify key elements within the domain. To ensure the generation of syntactically valid programs in domain-specific languages, and to accommodate environmental constraints, an error-assisted iterative prompting procedure is introduced, which facilitates the generation of reliable and expected code. Experimental results demonstrate the model's proficiency in accurately responding to manufacturing-related queries and its effectiveness in generating reliable code, where the accuracy of judgment querying can experience an improvement of approximately 4.1%.

Most recent work on LLMs in computing education has shown that they are capable of solving most introductory programming (CS1) exercises, exam questions, Parsons problems, and several other types of exercises and questions. Some work has investigated the ability of LLMs to solve CS2 problems as well. However, it remains unclear how well LLMs fare against more advanced upper-division coursework, such as proofs in algorithms courses. After all, while known to be proficient in many programming tasks, LLMs have been shown to have more difficulties in forming mathematical proofs. In this paper, we investigate the ability of LLMs to solve mathematical proofs by using Proof Blocks, a tool previously shown to efficaciously teach proofs to students. Our results show that GPT-3.5 is almost completely unable to provide correct solutions (11.4%), while GPT-4 shows a significant increase in correctness (64.8%). However, even given this improvement, current models still struggle to correctly order lines in a proof.

Experimental Evidence of Gender Bias in Recommendation Letters Generated by ChatGPT,chatbot; generative artificial intelligence; generative AI; gender bias; large language models; letters of recommendation; recommendation letter; language model; chatbots; artificial intelligence; AI; gender-based language; human written; real-world; scenario,"Background: Artificial intelligence chatbots such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) have garnered excitement about their potential for delegating writing tasks ordinarily performed by humans. Many of these tasks (eg, writing recommendation letters) have social and professional ramifications, making the potential social biases in ChatGPT's underlying language model a serious concern. Objective: Three preregistered studies used the text analysis program Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count to investigate gender bias in recommendation letters written by ChatGPT in human -use sessions (N=1400 total letters). Methods: We conducted analyses using 22 existing Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count dictionaries, as well as 6 newly created dictionaries based on systematic reviews of gender bias in recommendation letters, to compare recommendation letters generated for the 200 most historically popular male and female names in the United States. Study 1 used 3 different letter -writing prompts intended to accentuate professional accomplishments associated with male stereotypes, female stereotypes, or neither. Study 2 examined whether lengthening each of the 3 prompts while holding the between -prompt word count constant modified the extent of bias. Study 3 examined the variability within letters generated for the same name and prompts. We hypothesized that when prompted with gender -stereotyped professional accomplishments, ChatGPT would evidence gender -based language differences replicating those found in systematic reviews of human -written recommendation letters (eg, more affiliative, social, and communal language for female names; more agentic and skill -based language for male names). Results: Significant differences in language between letters generated for female versus male names were observed across all prompts, including the prompt hypothesized to be neutral, and across nearly all language categories tested. Historically female names received significantly more social referents (5/6, 83% of prompts), communal or doubt -raising language (4/6, 67% of prompts), personal pronouns (4/6, 67% of prompts), and clout language (5/6, 83% of prompts). Contradicting the study hypotheses, some gender differences (eg, achievement language and agentic language) were significant in both the hypothesized and nonhypothesized directions, depending on the prompt. Heteroscedasticity between male and female names was observed in multiple linguistic categories, with greater variance for historically female names than for historically male names. Conclusions: ChatGPT reproduces many gender -based language biases that have been reliably identified in investigations of human -written reference letters, although these differences vary across prompts and language categories. Caution should be taken when using ChatGPT for tasks that have social consequences, such as reference letter writing. The methods developed in this study may be useful for ongoing bias testing among progressive generations of chatbots across a range of real -world scenarios.

While some customers initially resisted interacting with chatbots, the COVID-19 outbreak caused them to reconsider. Motivated by this observation, we explore how disruptive situations, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, stimulate customers' willingness to interact with chatbots. Drawing on the theory of consumption values, we employed interviews to identify emotional, epistemic, functional, and social values that potentially shape willingness to interact with chatbots. Findings point to six values and suggest that disruptive situations stimulate how the values influence WTI with chatbots. Following theoretical insights that values collectively contribute to behaviour, we set up a scenario-based study and employed a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. We show that customers who experience all values are willing to interact with chatbots, and those who experience none are not, irrespective of disruptive situations. We show that disruptive situations stimulate the willingness to interact with chatbots among customers with configurations of values that would otherwise not have been sufficient. We complement the picture of relevant values for technology interaction by highlighting the epistemic value of curiosity as an important driver of willingness to interact with chatbots.

The major goal is not just to enhance agricultural output per hectare but also to enhance crop quality while protecting the natural environment. Weeds pose a significant threat to crops as they consume nutrients, water, and light, thereby reducing crop productivity. Spraying the entire field uniformly to control weeds not only incurs high costs but also has adverse environmental effects. To address the limitations of conventional weed control methods, in this research, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based techniques are proposed to identify and categorize weeds in crops. For ML-based techniques, several statistical and texture-based features are extracted, including central image and Hu moments, mean absolute deviation, Shannon entropy, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and local binary patterns (LBP), contrast, energy, homogeneity, dissimilarity, correlation, and summarized local binary pattern histogram. YOLOv8m is employed to identify weeds and for weed classification, features extracted from two standard benchmark datasets, CottonWeedID15 and Earlycrop-weed are fed to Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) while employing Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the classes. In addition to ML-based techniques, Deep learners such as VGG16, VGG19, Xception, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, and ConvNeXtBase are trained on raw data with balanced classes for automated feature extraction and classification. Among the ML-based techniques, SVM with a polynomial kernel achieves 99.5% accuracy on the early crop weed dataset, and Artificial neural network attains 89% accuracy on the Cottonweedid15 dataset. Meanwhile, the combined employment of ConvNeXt and Random Forest results in the highest accuracy among DLs, specifically 98% on the early crop weed dataset and 90% on the Cottonweedid15 dataset. The high accuracy achieved underscores the practical viability of these methods, offering a sustainable and cost-effective solution for modern agriculture.",Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU); University of Duisburg Essen,"Rehman, SU (corresponding author), Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ IMSIU, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Riyadh 11432, Saudi Arabia.",,2024,12,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3355017

These models, including Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT)-3.5 (OpenAI), GPT-4 (OpenAI), and Bard (Google LLC), find applications beyond natural language processing, attracting interest from academia and industry. Students are actively leveraging LLMs to enhance learning experiences and prepare for Objective: This comparative analysis aims to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions. Methods: In this paper, we evaluated the performance of the 3 mainstream LLMs, namely GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Google Bard, in answering questions related to the NEET-2023 exam. The questions of the NEET were provided to these artificial intelligence models, and the responses were recorded and compared against the correct answers from the official answer key. Consensus was used to evaluate the performance of all 3 models. Results: It was evident that GPT-4 passed the entrance test with flying colors (300/700, 42.9%), showcasing exceptional performance. On the other hand, GPT-3.5 managed to meet the qualifying criteria, but with a substantially lower score (145/700, 20.7%). However, Bard (115/700, 16.4%) failed to meet the qualifying criteria and did not pass the test. GPT-4 demonstrated consistent superiority over Bard and GPT-3.5 in all 3 subjects. Specifically, GPT-4 achieved accuracy rates of 73% (29/40) in physics, 44% (16/36) in chemistry, and 51% (50/99) in biology. Conversely, GPT-3.5 attained an accuracy rate of 45% (18/40) in physics, 33% (13/26) in chemistry, and 34% (34/99) in biology. The accuracy consensus metric showed that the matching responses between GPT-4 and Bard, as well as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, had higher incidences of being correct, at 0.56 and 0.57, respectively, compared to the matching responses between Bard and GPT-3.5, which stood at 0.42. When all 3 models were considered together, their matching responses reached the highest accuracy consensus of 0.59. Conclusions: The study's findings provide valuable insights into the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions. GPT-4 emerged as the most accurate model, highlighting its potential for educational applications. Cross-checking responses across models may result in confusion as the compared models (as duos or a trio) tend to agree on only a little over half of the correct responses. Using GPT-4 as one of the compared models will result in higher accuracy consensus. The results underscore the suitability of LLMs for high-stakes exams and their positive impact on education.

Although we highlight the potential of these data sets in advancing data science education and health care artificial intelligence, we also emphasize the need for continued research into the inherent limitations of synthetic data.",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; Ingham Institute for Applied Medical Research; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Kuo, NIH (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Ctr Big Data Res Hlth, Level 2,AGSM Bldg G27,Botany St, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",,2024,10,10.2196/51388

As the frequency and diversity of cybersecurity attacks continue to rise, the importance of incident detection has significantly increased. IoT devices are expanding rapidly, resulting in a growing need for efficient techniques to autonomously identify network-based attacks in IoT networks with both high precision and minimal computational requirements. This paper presents SecurityBERT, a novel architecture that leverages the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model for cyber threat detection in IoT networks. During the training of SecurityBERT, we incorporated a novel privacy-preserving encoding technique called Privacy-Preserving Fixed-Length Encoding (PPFLE). We effectively represented network traffic data in a structured format by combining PPFLE with the Byte-level Byte-Pair Encoder (BBPE) Tokenizer. Our research demonstrates that SecurityBERT outperforms traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), in cyber threat detection. Employing the Edge-IIoTset cybersecurity dataset, our experimental analysis shows that SecurityBERT achieved an impressive 98.2% overall accuracy in identifying fourteen distinct attack types, surpassing previous records set by hybrid solutions such as GAN-Transformer-based architectures and CNN-LSTM models. With an inference time of less than 0.15 seconds on an average CPU and a compact model size of just 16.7MB, SecurityBERT is ideally suited for real-life traffic analysis and a suitable choice for deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices.",Technology Innovation Institute; University of Manchester; Universidade Federal de Amazonas; Khalifa University of Science & Technology,"Ferrag, MA (corresponding author), Technol Innovat Inst, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",,2024,12,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3363469
