"Tortora, L",Beyond Discrimination: Generative AI Applications and Ethical Challenges in Forensic Psychiatry,forensic psychiatry; forensic AI; generative AI; generative artificial intelligence; discriminative AI; ethical AI; large language models; large generative AI models,"The advent and growing popularity of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) holds the potential to revolutionise AI applications in forensic psychiatry and criminal justice, which traditionally relied on discriminative AI algorithms. Generative AI models mark a significant shift from the previously prevailing paradigm through their ability to generate seemingly new realistic data and analyse and integrate a vast amount of unstructured content from different data formats. This potential extends beyond reshaping conventional practices, like risk assessment, diagnostic support, and treatment and rehabilitation plans, to creating new opportunities in previously underexplored areas, such as training and education. This paper examines the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence on AI applications in forensic psychiatry and criminal justice. First, it introduces generative AI and its prevalent models. Following this, it reviews the current applications of discriminative AI in forensic psychiatry. Subsequently, it presents a thorough exploration of the potential of generative AI to transform established practices and introduce novel applications through multimodal generative models, data generation and data augmentation. Finally, it provides a comprehensive overview of ethical and legal issues associated with deploying generative AI models, focusing on their impact on individuals as well as their broader societal implications. In conclusion, this paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse concerning the dynamic challenges of generative AI applications in forensic contexts, highlighting potential opportunities, risks, and challenges. It advocates for interdisciplinary collaboration and emphasises the necessity for thorough, responsible evaluations of generative AI models before widespread adoption into domains where decisions with substantial life-altering consequences are routinely made.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,MAR 8,15,,10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1346059,13

The UIST community has a unique vantage point that can lead to critical contributions in envisioning a future of interactive computing that appropriately leverages the power of these new generative AI models. However, we are only just beginning to understand the research area that exists at the intersection of interaction and generative AI. By bringing together members of the UIST community interested in this intersection, we seek to initiate discussions on the potential of generative AI in architecting new forms of interactions. Key topics of interest include the exploration of novel categories of interactions made possible by generative AI, the development of methods for enabling more powerful and direct user control of generative AI, and the identification of model and architecture requirements for generative AI in interaction literature. The workshop will foster community building and produce concrete deliverables, including a research agenda, model/architecture requirements, and a simulated debate generated by a generative agent architecture.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,,,,10.1145/3586182.3617431,3

What are the structural conditions for governing generative AI systems? To answer this question, it is crucial to situate generative AI systems as regulatory objects: material items that can be governed. On this conceptual basis, we introduce three high-level conditions to structure research and policy agendas on generative AI governance: industrial observability, public inspectability, and technical modifiability. Empirically, we explicate those conditions with a focus on the EU's AI Act, grounding the analysis of oversight mechanisms for generative AI systems in their granular material properties as observable, inspectable, and modifiable objects. Those three conditions represent an action plan to help us perceive generative AI systems as negotiable objects, rather than seeing them as mysterious forces that pose existential risks for humanity.",SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,2023 NOV 29,,,10.1177/14614448231214811,19

"Yin, M; Han, BX; Ryu, SH; Hua, M",Acceptance of Generative AI in the Creative Industry: Examining the Role of AI Anxiety in the UTAUT2 Model,UTAUT; Generative AI; AI anxiety; creative professionals,"With the boosting entrenchment of Generative artificial intelligence (AI) across the creative markets, little is explored around the opinions of those who are within the influenced industries. How well professionals in the creative domains are viewing and embracing this newly emerged technology awaits verification. Using a survey method, this study shed light on the underpinning factors that could predict professionals' acceptance and usage intention of Generative AI under the status quo. By integrating the expanded Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model, the study incorporates the dimension of AI anxiety into the framework. Regression analyses reveal that acceptance and usage intention of Generative AI can be predicted by factors including performance expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, habit, and AI anxiety, while effort expectancy, facility conditions, and price value cannot predict users' intention yet at current situations. The study shows the importance of the emotional attitudes of users and provides stakeholders with insights to develop Generative AI products to better fit the adaptability of users. Findings suggest that people who are actively involved in the creative and cultural economies favour using Generative AI, even when undergoing AI learning anxiety. Participants with a relatively higher level of education perform with more resilience and stability when faced with AI-related situations, as they are less possible to withdraw from future usage though undergoing the fear of Generative AI products, and they appear to less addictively rely on Generative AI tools despite all the merits.",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,,14059,,10.1007/978-3-031-48057-7_18,23

"Sachan, S; Liu, X",Blockchain-based auditing of legal decisions supported by explainable AI and generative AI tools,Legal; Law; Explainable AI; Blockchain; Generative AI; Responsible AI,"Generative AI tools powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced capabilities in understanding and articulating legal facts closer to the level of legal practitioners. However, scholars hold contrasting views on the reliability of the reasoning behind a decision derived from LLMs due to its black-box nature. Law firms are vigilant in recognizing the potential risks of violating confidentiality and inappropriate exposure of sensitive legal data through the prompt sent to Generative AI. This research attempts to find an equilibrium between responsible usage and control of human legal professionals over content produced by Generative AI through regular audits. It investigates the potential of Generative AI in drafting correspondence for pre-litigation decisions derived from an eXplainable AI (XAI) algorithm. This research presents an end-to-end process of designing the architecture and methodology for a blockchain-based auditing system. It detects unauthorized alterations of data repositories containing the decisions by an XAI model and automated textual explanation by Generative AI. The automated auditing by blockchain facilitates responsible usage of AI technologies and reduces discrepancies in tracing the accountability of adversarial decisions. It conceptualizes the two algorithms. First, strategic on-chain (within blockchain) and off-chain (outside blockchain) data storage in compliance with the data protection laws and critical requirements of stakeholders in a legal firm. Second, auditing by comparison of the unique signature as Merkle roots of files stored off-chain with their immutable blockchain counterpart.

A specific subset, generative artificial intelligence, has seen significant growth, particularly in late 2022. Tools like ChatGPT, Dall-E, or Midjourney have democratized access to Large Language Models, enabling the creation of human-like content. However, the concept 'Generative Artificial Intelligence' lacks a universally accepted definition, leading to potential misunderstandings. While a model that produces any output can be technically seen as generative, the Artificial Intelligent research community often reserves the term for complex models that generate high-quality, human-like material. This paper presents a literature mapping of AI-driven content generation, analyzing 631 solutions published over the last five years to better understand and characterize the Generative Artificial Intelligence landscape. Our findings suggest a dichotomy in the understanding and application of the term Generative AI.

One such system is text-to-image generative AI (e.g. Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E), which automates humans' artistic execution to generate digital artworks. Utilizing a dataset of over 4 million artworks from more than 50,000 unique users, our research shows that over time, text-to-image AI significantly enhances human creative productivity by 25% and increases the value as measured by the likelihood of receiving a favorite per view by 50%. While peak artwork Content Novelty, defined as focal subject matter and relations, increases over time, average Content Novelty declines, suggesting an expanding but inefficient idea space. Additionally, there is a consistent reduction in both peak and average Visual Novelty, captured by pixel-level stylistic elements. Importantly, AI-assisted artists who can successfully explore more novel ideas, regardless of their prior originality, may produce artworks that their peers evaluate more favorably. Lastly, AI adoption decreased value capture (favorites earned) concentration among adopters.

We found that designers not only would fall in a dilemma when deciding whether to consider AI as a co-creative agent according to different stakeholders' interests, but they also face many challenges in effectively co-creating with the current systems, including challenges in consistently adjusting AI outputs and getting design inspiration within the iterative generation process, etc. Based on our findings, we concluded both the epistemological and creative patterns of collaborating with generative AI and high-lighted several design opportunities from both technical and ethical perspectives to better support future designer-AI co-creation.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,,,,10.1145/3629606.3629675,18

The production function accounts for task-interdependencies, the worker-GAI interaction and indistinguishability between human-created and AI-generated outputs. We show that workers and GAI represent two distinct but interdependent sides of the production, that jointly generate a network externality in learning that drives productivity. We find that in open learning organizations favoring the worker-GAI interaction, GAI should be matched to workers based on their ability to detect errors. We analyze configurations where the worker-GAI interaction is limited, referred as closed learning organizations, including firms banning the use of GAI, technological superclusters and emergence of small entrepreneurs innovating with GAI.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

Platforms, repositories, clouds, and the automation of tools and processes have been proven to improve productivity, cost, and quality. Generative AI, with its rapidly expanding capabilities, is a major step forward in this field. As a new key enabling technology, it can be used for many purposes, from creative dimensions to replacing repetitive and manual tasks. The number of opportunities increases with the capabilities of large-language models (LLMs). This has raised concerns about ethics, education, regulation, intellectual property, and even criminal activities. We analyzed the potential of generative AI and LLM technologies for future software development paths. We propose four primary scenarios, model trajectories for transitions between them, and reflect against relevant software development operations.

This mixed methods study examines the views of educators (n = 318) from a diverse range of teaching levels, experience levels, discipline areas, and regions about the impact of AI on teaching and assessment, the ways that they believe teaching and assessment should change, and the key motivations for changing their practices. The majority of teachers felt that generative AI would have a major or profound impact on teaching and assessment, though a sizeable minority felt it would have a little or no impact. Teaching level, experience, discipline area, region, and gender all significantly influenced perceived impact of generative AI on teaching and assessment. Higher levels of awareness of generative AI predicted higher perceived impact, pointing to the possibility of an 'ignorance effect'. Thematic analysis revealed the specific curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment changes that teachers feel are needed as a result of generative AI, which centre around learning with AI, higher-order thinking, ethical values, a focus on learning processes and face-to-face relational learning. Teachers were most motivated to change their teaching and assessment practices to increase the performance expectancy of their students and themselves.

In a controlled study with 32 software engineers, we examined whether such imperfect outputs are helpful in the context of Java-to-Python code translation. When aided by the outputs of a code translation model, participants produced code with fewer errors than when working alone. We also examined how the quality and quantity of AI translations affected the work process and quality of outcomes, and observed that providing multiple translations had a larger impact on the translation process than varying the quality of provided translations. Our results tell a complex, nuanced story about the benefits of generative code models and the challenges software engineers face when working with their outputs.

Far from a glitch or unintentional error, these endemic issues are a function of the interlocking systems of oppression upon which AI is built. Using the analytical framework of Empire, this paper demonstrates that we live not simply in the age of AI but in the age of AI Empire. Specifically, we show that this networked and distributed global order is rooted in heteropatriarchy, racial capitalism, white supremacy, and coloniality and perpetuates its influence through the mechanisms of extractivism, automation, essentialism, surveillance, and containment. Therefore, we argue that any attempt at reforming AI from within the same interlocking oppressive systems that created it is doomed to failure and, moreover, risks exacerbating existing harm.

"Gross, N",What ChatGPT Tells Us about Gender: A Cautionary Tale about Performativity and Gender Biases in AI,gender; gender bias; ChatGPT; large language models; generative AI; performativity; ethical AI,"Large language models and generative AI, such as ChatGPT, have gained influence over people's personal lives and work since their launch, and are expected to scale even further. While the promises of generative artificial intelligence are compelling, this technology harbors significant biases, including those related to gender. Gender biases create patterns of behavior and stereotypes that put women, men and gender-diverse people at a disadvantage. Gender inequalities and injustices affect society as a whole. As a social practice, gendering is achieved through the repeated citation of rituals, expectations and norms. Shared understandings are often captured in scripts, including those emerging in and from generative AI, which means that gendered views and gender biases get grafted back into social, political and economic life. This paper's central argument is that large language models work performatively, which means that they perpetuate and perhaps even amplify old and non-inclusive understandings of gender. Examples from ChatGPT are used here to illustrate some gender biases in AI. However, this paper also puts forward that AI can work to mitigate biases and act to 'undo gender'.",MDPI,AUG,12,8,10.3390/socsci12080435,15

The emergence of AI in content creation has ignited debate regarding its potential to comprehend and generate human language, creating content that is often indistinguishable from that produced by humans. This shift from organic (human-created) to synthetic (AI-created) content presents a new frontier in the educational sphere, particularly in the context of OER and OEP. The paper explores the generative AI's capabilities in OER and OEP, such as automatic content generation, resource curation, updating existing resources, co-creation and facilitating collaborative learning. Nevertheless, it underscores the importance of addressing challenges like the quality and reliability of AI-generated content, data privacy, and equitable access to AI technologies. The critical discussion extends to a contentious issue, ownership in OER/OEP. While AI-generated works lack human authorship and copyright protection, the question of legal liability and recognition of authorship remains a significant concern. In response, the concept of prompt engineering and co-creation with AI is presented as a potential solution, viewing AI not as authors, but powerful tools augmenting authors' abilities. By examining generative AI's integration with OER and OEP, this paper encourages further research and discussion to harness AI's power while addressing potential concerns, thereby contributing to the dialogue on responsible and effective use of generative AI in education.",INT COUNCIL OPEN & DISTANCE EDUCATION,,15,3,10.55982/openpraxis.15.3.579,7

A number of companies are seeking to apply AI to music production and consumption, and amongst them several are seeking to reinvent the music listening experience as adaptive, interactive, functional and infinitely generative. These are bold objectives, having no clear roadmap for what designs, technologies and use cases, if any, will be successful. Thus each company relies on speculative product visions. Through four case studies of such companies, I consider how product visions must carefully provide a clear plan for developers and investors, whilst also remaining open to agile user-centred product development strategies, which I discuss in terms of the 'blind search' nature of innovation. I suggest that innovation in this area needs to be understood in terms of technological emergence, which is neither technologically determinist nor driven entirely by the visions of founders, but through a complex of interacting forces. I also consider, through these cases, how, through the accumulation of residual value, all such start-up work risks being exapted for more familiar extractive capitalist agendas under the general process that Doctorow calls enshittification. Lastly, I consider a number of other more specific ways in which these projects, if their growth is achieved, could influence music culture more broadly.",SPRINGER,2024 MAR 1,,,10.1007/s00146-024-01862-x,19

"Rowland, DR",Two frameworks to guide discussions around levels of acceptable use of generative AI in student academic research and writing,Generative AI; academic integrity; academic writing pedagogy,"The capacity of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to perform at human-like levels on a range of tasks has created a challenging pedagogical tension within education. On the one hand, such tools pose significant threats to academic integrity, but on the other hand, employers will also expect graduating students to be proficient in the use of such tools so as to improve their productivity and performance levels. How best to balance this tension and produce students who can both work proficiently with discipline-relevant generative AI tools and also add significant value to anything a generative AI system can produce will be a long-term research project for educators. In the short term, however, since many students are already widely using or exploring the use of such tools, it is important for educators to clearly delineate for students what level of use is acceptable or unacceptable for each assessment task. To help educators frame any discussion with their students about levels of acceptable use, this paper proposes two frameworks for the uses of generative AI to support academic writing. The first framework is relatively simple, and generalises ideas from long term discussions around the support-collaboration-collusion continuum to the case of generative AI support for academic writing. The second proposed framework is two dimensional, considering the different levels of support possible at each of six stages in the academic writing process. In addition, since helping students learn effective prompt engineering will need to be a pedagogical goal, use examples at each level of the second framework are provided, together with commentary about effective prompt engineering, issues to watch out for, and possible ways to acknowledge any such use. It is hoped that the analyses and examples provided in this paper will provide useful foundations for both discussions between educators and their students, and future research into how best to integrate the use of generative AI tools in higher education pedagogy.

In partnership with one of the world's leading consulting firms, we enlisted professional content creators and ChatGPT-4 to create advertising content for products and persuasive content for campaigns following the aforementioned paradigms. First, we find that, contrary to the expectations of some of the existing algorithm aversion literature on conventional predictive AI, the content generated by generative AI and augmented AI is perceived as of higher quality than that produced by human experts and augmented human experts. Second, revealing the source of content production reduces-but does not reverse-the perceived quality gap between human- and AI-generated content. This bias in evaluation is predominantly driven by human favoritism rather than AI aversion: Knowing that the same content is created by a human expert increases its (reported) perceived quality, but knowing that AI is involved in the creation process does not affect its perceived quality. Further analysis suggests this bias is not due to a 'quality prime' as knowing the content they are about to evaluate comes from competent creators (e.g., industry professionals and state-of-the-art AI) without knowing exactly that the creator of each piece of content does not increase participants' perceived quality.",CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NOV 28,18,,10.1017/jdm.2023.37,16

A comparative vision between American and European Union Copyright Laws.,Artificial Intelligence; Generative AI; US copyright; European copyright; authorship,"This paper addresses the question of whether generative AI can create copyrightable works by making a comparative analysis between European Union law and U.S. copyright law. First, it is argued that for copyright law it does not seem possible for an entity other than a human being to be the copyright holder, thus ruling out the possibility of generative AI being considered a copyright holder. It is established that in US copyright the door it may be possible to register part of a work made using generative AI, and that in the EU this door remains open and pending evolution, although European jurisprudence already gives some guidelines. Afterwards, this paper explores possible infringement of exploitation rights in the different parts of the training process of generative AI models and in the activities that lead to the generation of content that is like intellectual works. It is concluded that in US law there is a gap in knowledge as to whether fair use would cover these types of activities. In European Law, although there are exceptions such as those in Directive 2001/29, it is not at all clear whether this will be sufficient to cover these activities, or whether the authorization of the rights owner will be necessary.

However, the intricacy of sequence-function relationships continues to obscure our grasp of enzyme behaviors and curtails our capabilities in rational enzyme engineering. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), known for its proficiency in handling intricate data distributions, holds the potential to offer novel perspectives in enzyme research. Generative models could discern elusive patterns within the vast sequence space and uncover new functional enzyme sequences. This review highlights the recent advancements in employing generative AI for enzyme sequence analysis. We delve into the impact of generative AI in predicting mutation effects on enzyme fitness, catalytic activity and stability, rationalizing the laboratory evolution of de novo enzymes, and decoding protein sequence semantics and their application in enzyme engineering. Notably, the prediction of catalytic activity and stability of enzymes using natural protein sequences serves as a vital link, indicating how enzyme catalysis shapes enzyme evolution. Overall, we foresee that the integration of generative AI into enzyme studies will remarkably enhance our knowledge of enzymes and expedite the creation of superior biocatalysts. This Review underscores the latest advances in applying generative AI to the analysis of enzyme sequences, which has deepened our insight into enzyme evolution and catalysis, thereby advancing enzyme engineering.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS,NOV 6,10,12,10.1093/nsr/nwad331,13

However, the systematic review process is a resource -intensive and time-consuming process. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a potential solution to automate tedious tasks. Objective: This study aimed to explore the feasibility of using generative AI tools to automate time-consuming and resource -intensive tasks in a systematic review process and assess the scope and limitations of using such tools. Methods: We used the design science research methodology. The solution proposed is to use cocreation with a generative AI, such as ChatGPT, to produce software code that automates the process of conducting systematic reviews. Results: A triggering prompt was generated, and assistance from the generative AI was used to guide the steps toward developing, executing, and debugging a Python script. Errors in code were solved through conversational exchange with ChatGPT, and a tentative script was created. The code pulled the mHealth solutions from the Google Play Store and searched their descriptions for keywords that hinted toward evidence base. The results were exported to a CSV file, which was compared to the initial outputs of other similar systematic review processes. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of using generative AI to automate the time-consuming process of conducting systematic reviews of mHealth apps. This approach could be particularly useful for researchers with limited coding skills. However, the study has limitations related to the design science research methodology, subjectivity bias, and the quality of the search results used to train the language model.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",,10,,10.2196/48949,10

"He, Y",Definition of the psychological verb (ai) 'love' in Chinese: an approach sub-lexical,ai 'love'; semantic extension; mutual coordination; sublexical features; generative mechanisms,"This paper analyzes the Chinese polysemic expressions that contain the verb (ai) 'love', such as (ai erzi) 'love the son', (ai yanjing) 'take care of eyes', (ai tudou) 'like to eat potatoes', (ai yuangong) 'appreciate the employees', (ai haoche) 'wish to have luxurious car' or (ai guo shou fa) 'respect the country and the laws'. Within the theoretical framework of Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky, 1995), this research defends that the Chinese psychological verb (ai) 'love' has a minimal meaning ('feel an intense and pleasant emotion'), which can be extended through the mutual coordination within the verb and the information codified in the internal structure of the word it combines. The processes of lexical concordance that legitimize the different meanings of the verb are what are known as generative mechanisms, in terms of the TLG, whose operation we are going to analyze.","UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, SERVICIO PUBLICACIONES",,,78,10.5209/CLAC.64374,28

The field of explainable AI (XAI) seeks to make complex and opaque AI models such as neural networks more understandable to people. One approach to making generative AI models more understandable is to impose a small number of semantically meaningful attributes on generative AI models. This paper contributes a systematic examination of the impact that different combinations of variational auto-encoder models (measureVAE and adversarialVAE), configurations of latent space in the AI model (from 4 to 256 latent dimensions), and training datasets (Irish folk, Turkish folk, classical, and pop) have on music generation performance when 2 or 4 meaningful musical attributes are imposed on the generative model. To date, there have been no systematic comparisons of such models at this level of combinatorial detail. Our findings show that measureVAE has better reconstruction performance than adversarialVAE which has better musical attribute independence. Results demonstrate that measureVAE was able to generate music across music genres with interpretable musical dimensions of control, and performs best with low complexity music such as pop and rock. We recommend that a 32 or 64 latent dimensional space is optimal for 4 regularised dimensions when using measureVAE to generate music across genres. Our results are the first detailed comparisons of configurations of state-of-the-art generative AI models for music and can be used to help select and configure AI models, musical features, and datasets for more understandable generation of music.",SPRINGERNATURE,FEB,21,1,10.1007/s11633-023-1457-1,17

Six experiments were conducted based on the accessibility-diagnosticity framework. These examined the moderating role of the prominence and type of incorrect information and their effects on decision-making. The results show that participants perceived more accuracy and trustworthiness, leading to stronger intentions to visit when incorrect information was absent. However, there was a decline in their intentions to visit when incorrect information was present and more prominent or in the same domain. This effect diminished when multiple domains were involved or when participants were focused on the initial task. The research highlights that both the prominence and type of incorrect information are boundary conditions and provides insights into AI applications in tourism. Furthermore, it offers practical implications for online travel agencies in terms of user interface and user experience design planning.",SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,2023 NOV 29,,,10.1177/00472875231212996,23

DC-VAE is a recent approach we have proposed for anomaly detection in network measurement multivariate data, which uses Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs) and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to model complex and high-dimensional MTS data. However, detecting anomalies using VAEs can result in performance degradation and even catastrophic forgetting when trained on dynamic and evolving network measurements, particularly in the event of concept drifts. We extend DC-VAE to a continual learning setup, leveraging the generative AI properties of the underlying models to deal with continually evolving data. We introduce GenDeX, an approach to Generative AI-based anomaly detection which compresses the patterns extracted from past measurements into a generative model that can synthesize MTS data out of input Gaussian noise, mimicking the characteristics of the MTS data used for training. GenDeX relies on a Deep Generative Replay paradigm to realize continual learning, combining synthesized past MTS measurements with new observations to update the detection model. Using a large-scale, multi-dimensional network monitoring dataset collected from an operational mobile Internet Service Provider (ISP), we showcase the functionality of DCVAE in the event of concept drifts, and study in-depth its generative characteristics, assessing GenDeX synthetically generated MTS examples.

Amid the rapid growth and maturing of Generative AI technologies such as Large Language Models (like ChatGPT by OpenAI) a rapid growth of both immediate and potential applications can be seen. The implications for the economy and industries of this technological shift will be discussed. The foreseeable scenarios for the level and types of adoption that GAI might achieve-from useful analytical tool, invaluable assistant to the white-collar workers of the world to being trusted with a wide array of business and life-critical decision making. Both disruptive and premium service opportunities are foreseen. For instance, general purpose models may provide quality service-such as copywriting-to overserved customers leaving human writers as the premium option. In this context, overserved customers would be those who would be satisfied with a non-human, potentially less creative content. On the other hand highly specialized models-specifically trained in a given domain and with access to proprietary knowledge can possibly provide a premium service over that provided by human experts. It is expected that some jobs will be replaced by new AI applications. However, new workplaces will emerge. Not only the obvious expert-level data scientist roles but also low grade, model supervisors-people training the models, assessing the quality of responses given and handling escalations.

Considering that generative artificial intelligence tools are likely to be used either to inform or to disinform, evaluating the (non)human nature of machine-generated content is questioned, especially regarding the 'hallucination' phenomenon, which relates to generated content that does not correspond to real-world input. In this study, we argue that assessing machine-generated content is most reliable when done by humans because doing so involves critical consideration of the meaning of the information and its informative, misinformative or dis-informative value, which is related to the accuracy and reliability of the news. To explore human-based judgement methods, we developed the Information Disorder Level (IDL) index, a language-independent metric to evaluate the factuality of machine-generated content. It has been tested on a corpus of forty made-up and actual news stories generated with ChatGPT. For newsrooms using generative AI, results suggest that every piece of machine-generated content should be vetted and post-edited by humans before being published. From a digital media literacy perspective, the IDL index is a valuable tool to understand the limits of generative AI and trigger a reflection on what constitutes the factuality of a reported event.",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,,14397,,10.1007/978-3-031-47896-3_5,12

It uses context-aware GPT-4 to generate tailored responses to user queries from this KB, further refined through prompt engineering and guardrails.Results Evaluated against a specialized PGx question catalog, the AI assistant showed high efficacy in addressing user queries. Compared with OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5, it demonstrated better performance, especially in provider-specific queries requiring specialized data and citations. Key areas for improvement include enhancing accuracy, relevancy, and representative language in responses.Discussion The integration of context-aware GPT-4 with RAG significantly enhanced the AI assistant's utility. RAG's ability to incorporate domain-specific CPIC data, including recent literature, proved beneficial. Challenges persist, such as the need for specialized genetic/PGx models to improve accuracy and relevancy and addressing ethical, regulatory, and safety concerns.Conclusion This study underscores generative AI's potential for transforming healthcare provider support and patient accessibility to complex pharmacogenomic information. While careful implementation of large language models like GPT-4 is necessary, it is clear that they can substantially improve understanding of pharmacogenomic data.

Empirical findings have shown promising outcomes such as augmented human cognition and highly creative design products. Barriers still remain that prevent individuals from perceiving and adopting AI, entering into collaboration with AI and sustaining it over time. It is even more challenging for creative design industries to adopt and trust AI where these professionals value individual style and expression, and therefore require highly personalized and specialized AI assistance. In this paper, we present a holistic hybrid intelligence (HI) approach for individual experts to train and personalize their GD assistants on the fly. Our contribution to human-AI interaction is three-fold including i) a programmable common language between human and AI to represent the expert's design goals to the generative algorithm, ii) a human-centered continual training loop to seamlessly integrate AI-training into the expert's task workflow, iii) a hybrid intelligence narrative to address the psychological willingness to spend time and effort training such a virtual assistant. This integral approach enables individuals to directly communicate design goals to AI and seeks to create a psychologically safe space for adopting, training and improving AI without the fear of job-replacement. We concertize these constructs through a newly developed Hybrid Intelligence Technology Acceptance Model (HI-TAM). We used mixed methods to empirically evaluate this approach through the lens of HI-TAM with 8 architectural professionals working individually with a GD assistant to co-create floor plan layouts of office buildings.

We study the compute, energy, and carbon impacts of generative AI inference. Using ChatGPT as an exemplar, we create a workload model and compare request direction approaches (Local, Balance, CarbonMin), assessing their power use and carbon impacts. Our workload model shows that for ChatGPT-like services, inference dominates emissions, in one year producing 25x the carbon-emissions of training GPT-3. The workload model characterizes user experience, and experiments show that carbon emissions-aware algorithms (CarbonMin) can both maintain user experience and reduce carbon emissions dramatically (35%). We also consider a future scenario (2035 workload and power grids), and show that CarbonMin can reduce emissions by 56%. In both cases, the key is intelligent direction of requests to locations with low-carbon power. Combined with hardware technology advances, CarbonMin can keep emissions increase to only 20% compared to 2022 levels for 55x greater workload.

The author posits that the hybridity of the cyborg, which amalgamates human and artificial elements, invites a cascade of creative and emancipatory possibilities. The author critically examines the biases embedded in AI systems while gesturing toward the generative potential of AI-human entanglements. Drawing on Bakhtinian theories of dialogism, the author contends that crafting found poetry with AI could inspire writers to problematize the ideologies embedded into the corpus while teasing apart its elisions or contradictions, sparking new forms of expression at the interface of the organic and the artificial. Design/methodology/approach - To illustrate this approach to human-AI composing, the author shares a found poem that she wrote using ChatGPT alongside her reflection on the poem. The author reflects on her positionality as well as the positionality of her artificial interlocutor, interrogating the notion of subjectivity in relation to Bakhtinian dialogism and multivocality. Findings - Weaving tales of resilience in harmony or tension with AI could unravel threads of possibility as human writers enrich, deepen or complicate AI-generated texts. By composing with AI, writers can resist closure, infiltrate illusions of objectivity and speak back to AI and the dominant voices replicated in its systems. Originality/value - By encouraging students to critically engage with, question and complicate AI-generated texts, one can open avenues for alternative ways of thinking and writing, inspiring students to imagine and compose speculative futures.

This paper explores the human-AI relationship when generative AI is used to assist a writer suffering from writer's block. Research shows that talking to others is an effective strategy for blocked writers. This other no longer needs to be a human. I examine what happens when generative AI is brought into the writing loop: the nonlinear process of writing and rewriting a creative piece. The film Adaptation (2002. Directed by Spike Jonze, Performance by Nicolas Cage. Meryl Streep, and Chris Cooper. Columbia), written by Charlie Kaufman, is used as a case study of writer's block to illustrate several complexities of the disorder and to theorise potential openings and limitations for the use of AI. Through the film, writer's block is also explored as having a twin pathology of hypergraphia. Writing with AI is seen to mimic peculiarities of creative writing that include projecting one's inner voice and seeking a false self. In the example of Adaptation, one ultimately comes to appreciate too that suffering through a block unaided can propel a writer to make bold decisions and test the limits of human creativity.","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",JAN 2,21,1,10.1080/14790726.2023.2223176,12

The picture is complicated given the vast innovations envisioned to emerge by combining emerging technologies, as AI-enabled synthetic biology potentially scales up bioengineering into industrial biomanufacturing. However, the literature review indicates that goals such as maintaining a reasonable scope for innovation, or more ambitiously to foster a huge bioeconomy do not necessarily contrast with biosafety, but need to go hand in hand.

Without human oversight, guidance and responsible design and operation, such generative AI applications will remain a party trick with substantial potential for creating and spreading misinformation or harmful and inaccurate content at unprecedented scale. However, if positioned and developed responsibly as companions to humans augmenting but not replacing their role in decision making, knowledge retrieval and other cognitive processes, they could evolve into highly efficient, trustworthy, assistive tools for information management. This perspective describes how such tools could transform data management workflows in healthcare and medicine, explains how the underlying technology works, provides an assessment of risks and limitations, and proposes an ethical, technical, and cultural framework for responsible design, development, and deployment. It seeks to incentivise users, developers, providers, and regulators of generative AI that utilises LLMs to collectively prepare for the transformational role this technology could play in evidence-based sectors.",ELSEVIER,APR,90,,10.1016/j.ebiom.2023.104512,12

Our main contention is that the Guetta form of creativity with generative AI tools differs in certain important respects from what has come before.The paper describes an iterative, dynamic process of conception, prompting, generation, refining, and deployment to characterise creativity in this context. Nevertheless, we contend that copyright - specifically the concept of originality as articulated in US federal law - is a sufficiently durable legal mechanism that can manage these new cultural forms, and that the two basic requirements of modern copyright law (a tangible medium of expression and a modest degree of creativity) remain relevant in identifying the scope of legal protection. The paper argues that the David Guetta story reveals something more general about creativity in a digital age, namely that while hybrid-networked (i.e., human - corporate - machine) creators have always created hybridnetworked cultural forms (i.e., creations that blend human and technology-constituted elements), such hybridity becomes increasingly visible and complex in the context of a new world of generative AI. At the very least, earlier - and influential - models of creativity as human-driven involving creation ex nihilo become harder to sustain in a new age of generative AI. But this does not mean copyright or notions of originality are redundant or that copyright law cannot accommodate Guetta and other cases. Such an account seems important as it challenges the hegemonic and reductive view that AI generates artistic works autonomously and avoids reducing the copyright issues raised by such creative works to the related but distinct question of whether learning models rely on copyrighted data. As such, copyright law should remain an important mechanism to facilitate genuine creators who are using AI systems in innovative and unique ways to push the boundaries of their creativity.",ELSEVIER ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY,NOV,51,,10.1016/j.clsr.2023.105892,12

Referring to ethical decision-making theory, the research model extends the UTAUT2 model with three influencing factors: ethical awareness (EA), perceived ethical risks (PER), and AI ethical anxiety (AIEA). A sample of 226 university students was analysed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling technique (PLS-SEM). The research results further validate the effectiveness of UTAUT2. Furthermore, performance expectancy, hedonistic motivation, price value, and social influence all positively influence university students' BI to use generative AI products, except for effort expectancy. Facilitating conditions and habit show no significant impact on BI, but they can determine UB. The three extended factors from the ethical perspective play significant roles as well. AIEA and PER are not key determinants of BI. However, AIEA can directly inhibit UB. From the mediation analysis, although PER do not have a direct impact on UB, it inhibits UB indirectly through AIEA. Ethical awareness can positively influence BI. Nevertheless, it can also increase PER.

Although the impact of ChatGPT on academic integrity processes is a key concern, little is known about whether academics can reliably recognise texts that have been generated by AI. This qualitative study applies Turing's Imitation Game to investigate 16 education academics' perceptions of two pairs of texts written by either ChatGPT or a human. Pairs of texts, written in response to the same task, were used as the stimulus for interviews that probed academics' perceptions of text authorship and the textual features that were important in their decision-making. Results indicated academics were only able to identify AI-generated texts half of the time, highlighting the sophistication of contemporary generative AI technology. Academics perceived the following categories as important for their decision-making: voice, word usage, structure, task achievement and flow. All five categories of decision-making were variously used to rationalise both accurate and inaccurate decisions about text authorship.

Unlike conventional search engines, LLMs go beyond mere information retrieval, entering into the realm of discourse culture. Their outputs mimic well-considered, independent opinions or statements of facts, presenting a pretense of wisdom. This paper explores the potential transformative impact of LLMs on democratic societies. It delves into the concerns regarding the difficulty in distinguishing ChatGPT-generated texts from human output. The discussion emphasizes the essence of authorship, rooted in the unique human capacity for reason-a quality indispensable for democratic discourse and successful collaboration within free societies. Highlighting the potential threats to democracy, this paper presents three arguments: the Substitution argument, the Authenticity argument, and the Facts argument. These arguments highlight the potential risks that are associated with an overreliance on LLMs. The central thesis posits that widespread deployment of LLMs may adversely affect the fabric of a democracy if not comprehended and addressed proactively and properly. In proposing a solution, we advocate for an emphasis on education as a means to mitigate risks. We suggest cultivating thinking skills in children, fostering coherent thought formulation, and distinguishing between machine-generated output and genuine, i.e., human, reasoning. The focus should be on the responsible development and usage of LLMs, with the goal of augmenting human capacities in thinking, deliberating and decision-making rather than substituting them.",MDPI,FEB,9,1,10.3390/philosophies9010013,18

These tools can inspire and surprise users with algorithmic outputs that the users could not expect. However, users can struggle to align their intentions with unexpected algorithmic behaviors. My dissertation research studies how user expressions in art-making AI-CSTs need to be designed. With an interview study with 14 artists and a literature survey on 111 existing CSTs, I frst isolate three requirements: 1) allow users to express under-constrained intentions, 2) enable the tool and the user to co-learn the user expressions and the algorithmic behaviors, and 3) allow easy and expressive iteration. Based on these requirements, I introduce two tools, 1) Artinter, which learns how the users express their visual art concepts within their communication process for art commissions, and 2) TaleBrush, which facilitates the under-constrained and iterative expression of user intents through sketching-based story generation.

Overcoming this challenge requires integrating domain knowledge and nuances of the built environment to enhance context-awareness in automated site planning. This study therefore proposes the context-aware site planning generative adversarial networks (CAIN-GAN) framework. In the case study of New York City (NYC), CAIN-GAN demonstrates its capability to not only synthesize visually realistic and semantically reasonable design solutions, but also evaluate their performance in urban sustainability for informed decisionmaking.

The study collected public comments from YouTube news clips disseminated by three prominent broadcasters in South Korea between December 2022 and June 2023. Two dimensions of public perceptions were examined: sentiments and prevalent topics. Employing machine learning techniques, we conducted sentiment analysis and topic modelling on the crowdsourced dataset of 18,566 comments from 66 YouTube news clips. The first research question focused on public sentiments towards GenAI and education. Findings reveal a predominance of neutral sentiments. Rather than adopting extreme positions of complete acceptance or rejection, the public displayed an inclination to appreciate the intricate nuances of GenAI's implications. The second research question sought to identify the main topics emerging from public comments on GenAI and education. We identified 11 distinct topics where two topics are directly linked to educational implications: demands for changes in learning and assessment methods, and the use of GenAI in higher education. Based on the key findings, we draw implications that can inform a broader understanding of public sentiment and perspective towards GenAI and education.","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",JAN 2,44,1,10.1080/02188791.2023.2294699,20

However, fixating solely on potential misconduct is overshadowing a more profound, transformative interaction between learners and machines. This commentary article delves into the relationship between students and AI, aiming to highlight the need for revised pedagogical strategies in the AI age. We argue that the much-discussed approaches that prioritise AI literacy or augmented critical thinking might be inadequate. Instead, we contend that a more holistic approach emphasising self -regulated learning (SRL) and co-regulation of learning is needed. SRL promotes autonomy, adaptability, and a deeper understanding, qualities indispensable for navigating the intricacies of AI-enhanced learning environments. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a network of co-regulation, which underscores the intertwined learning processes between humans and machines. By positioning the self at the core of this network, we emphasise the indispensable role of individual agency in steering productive human-AI educational interactions. Our contention is that by fostering SRL and understanding co-regulated dynamics, educators can better equip learners for an interconnected AI-driven world.Practitioner Notes1.

Studies 1a and 1b present field evidence: Actual consumer interactions with two different companion AIs. Study 2 reports an extensive performance test of several commercially available companion AIs. Study 3 is an experiment testing consumer reaction to risky and unhelpful chatbot responses. The findings show that (1) mental health crises are apparent in a nonnegligible minority of conversations with users; (2) companion AIs are often unable to recognize, and respond appropriately to, signs of distress; and (3) consumers display negative reactions to unhelpful and risky chatbot responses, highlighting emerging reputational risks for generative AI companies.",JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,2023 DEC 19,,,10.1002/jcpy.1393,11

The rapid evolution of AI, especially generative AI and large language models (LLMs), have reignited the discussions about their potential impact on the healthcare industry, particularly regarding the role of healthcare providers. Concerning questions, can AI replace doctors? and will doctors who are using AI replace those who are not using it? have been echoed. To shed light on this debate, this article focuses on emphasizing the augmentative role of AI in healthcare, underlining that AI is aimed to complement, rather than replace, doctors and healthcare providers. The fundamental solution emerges with the human-AI collaboration, which combines the cognitive strengths of healthcare providers with the analytical capabilities of AI. A human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach ensures that the AI systems are guided, communicated, and supervised by human expertise, thereby maintaining safety and quality in healthcare services. Finally, the adoption can be forged further by the organizational process informed by the HITL approach to improve multidisciplinary teams in the loop. AI can create a paradigm shift in healthcare by complementing and enhancing the skills of healthcare providers, ultimately leading to improved service quality, patient outcomes, and a more efficient healthcare system.",SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,JUL,9,,10.1177/20552076231186520,5

We model a representative consumer who allocates their time between reading news and deceptive articles. We find that GenAI may induce consumers to inefficiently reallocate their time and increase the consumption of the lower value good, i.e. deceptive content (clickbait articles or fake news). Therefore, early-stage GenAI distorts the incentives of consumers and reduces their welfare. After GenAI technology reaches a certain threshold, however, consumers start benefiting from its advancements. Finally, we find that the negative effects of early-stage GenAI are exacerbated as they induce a lower level of investment in news production.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

This has been further pushed forward with the evolution of generative artificial intelligence (AI), including the emergence of large language models (LLMs), which is believed to be the cornerstone toward realizing self-governed, interactive AI agents. Motivated by this, in this paper, we aim to adapt the paradigm of LLMs to the Telecom domain. In particular, we fine-tune several LLMs including BERT, distilled BERT, RoBERTa and GPT-2, to the Telecom domain languages, and demonstrate a use case for identifying the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard working groups. We consider training the selected models on 3GPP technical documents (Tdoc) pertinent to years 2009-2019 and predict the Tdoc categories in years 2020-2023. The results demonstrate that fine-tuning BERT and RoBERTa model achieves 84.6% accuracy, while GPT-2 model achieves 83% in identifying 3GPP working groups. The distilled BERT model with around 50% less parameters achieves similar performance as others. This corroborates that fine-tuning pretrained LLM can effectively identify the categories of Telecom language.

Drawing on Bacchi's 'What's the problem represented to be' (WPR) framework, we analysed the GenAI policies of 20 world-leading universities to explore what are considered problems in this AI-mediated assessment landscape and how these problems are represented in policies. Although miscellaneous GenAI-related problems were mentioned in these policies (e.g. reliability of AI-generated outputs, equal access to GenAI), the primary problem represented is that students may not submit original work for assessment. In the current framing, GenAI is often viewed as a type of external assistance separate from the student's independent efforts and intellectual contribution, thereby undermining the originality of their work. We argue that such problem representation fails to acknowledge how the rise of GenAI further complicates the process of producing original work and what it means by originality in a time when knowledge production becomes increasingly distributed, collaborative and mediated by technology. Therefore, a critical silence in higher education policies concerns the evolving notion of originality in the digital age and a more inclusive approach to address the originality of students' work is required.","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",2024 JAN 27,,,10.1080/02602938.2024.2309963,14

When generative AI software such as ChatGPT generates ideas for people, they often generate false ideas. This occurrence has been called 'AI Hallucination'. It can include generating false text output that is extremely believable to completely gibberish. This source of potential misinformation has significant potential implications for the travel and tourism industry. Using survey responses from 900 consumers, this empirical study contributes to theorizing and examination of how consumers' awareness of AI Hallucination potential combines with existing concepts from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) when it comes to the decision to use generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT for tourism planning. This research also examines if the consumers are actually able to discern AI Hallucination and why they select to use AI technologies over other tourism information sources, such as aggregated peer review websites like TripAdvisor, government tourism websites, or social media influencers. The results indicate that many consumers chose error-filled AI tourism itineraries over other options because they trust the AI to be more impartial and customized than the other sources.","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",2024 JAN 19,,,10.1080/13683500.2023.2300032,16

The acquisition of diverse information has led to a diversification in consumer preferences and requirements. As consumer preferences diversify and online channels expand, there is an increasing need for companies to provide personalized marketing. Among the means of personalized marketing, personalized marketing messages are a key tool that can enhance customer engagement. However, a limitation of personalized marketing message services is the cost issue associated with manually writing individual marketing messages for personalization. To solve this problem, when developing automated technology for personalized marketing messages, there were concerns about the complexity of model development and the quality of messages generated automatically. In this study, we propose the Persuasive Message Intelligence (PMI) service, which utilizes the recently prominent Large Language Model for automated individual personalized marketing messages. PMI generates marketing messages through prompt engineering based on the theory of persuasion in marketing and prior research on AI-generated messages, and validates the elements of prompts through surveys.

At the same time, the focus of artists and their audiences shifts from the art as a text to the collaboration process between artificial intelligence (AI) and the involved social actors. This raises significant concerns between policymakers and other social actors looking for guidelines for the appropriate use of AI as a tool, collaborator or substitute for creative workers, which can have immediate and long-term impacts on society and culture. Semiotics of culture provides descriptive tools for understanding and evaluating artistic texts and their role in semiotic space, the semiosphere.

In formulating a response to these developments, educational institutions are constrained by a lack of clarity concerning human -machine communication and its relationship to models of education. Ideas and models from the cybernetic tradition can help to fill this gap. Two paradigms are distinguished: (1) the transmission paradigm (combining the model of learning implied by the instruments and processes of formal education and the conduit model of communication), and (2) the coordination paradigm (combining the constructivist model of learning and the coordination model of communication). It is proposed that these paradigms have long coexisted in educational practice in a modus vivendi, which is disrupted by LLMs. If an LLM can pass an examination, then from within the transmission paradigm this can only understood as demonstrating that the LLM has indeed learned and understood the material being assessed. At the same time, we know that LLMs do not in fact have the capacity to learn and understand, but rather generate a simulacrum of intelligence. It is argued that this paradox prevents educational institutions from formulating a coherent response to generative AI systems. However, within the coordination paradigm the interactions of LLMs and education institutions can be more easily understood and can be situated in a conversational model of learning. These distinctions can help institutions, educational leaders, and teachers, to frame the complex and nuanced questions raised by GenAI, and to chart a course towards its effective use in education. More specifically, they indicate that to benefit fully from the capabilities of generative AI education institutions need to recognize the validity of the coordination paradigm and adapt their processes and instruments accordingly.",UNIV INT RIOJA-UNIR,MAR,8,5,10.9781/ijimai.2024.02.008,83

My focus is on the practical ethical consequences for what we should expect of medical students in terms of medical professionalism and ethical reasoning, and how this can be tested in a context where LLMs are relatively easy available. If we continue to expect ethical competences of medical professionalism of future physicians, how much - if at all - should we worry that such generative AI may compromise adequate testing of medical students' abilities in this regard? I mainly focus on assessment methods based on written assignments of the 'student paper' type and consider whether LLMs make it unfeasible for assessors to gauge whether output is student-generated or 'machine-generated' and, if so, whether this is a problem. My take on this research question unfolds in three interwoven arguments, claiming that the advent of LLMs may offer a momentum (i) to reaffirm the importance of context-sensitive interpretation and specification of ethical principles in medical ethics training, (ii) to provide more supportive circumstances to assessors to allow them to meet scoring demands entailed by the importance that is placed on medical professionalism, and (iii) to complement written assignments with verbal (group) discussion to train and test students' skills to habitually recognize that 'moral solutions' can be normatively questioned and specified from various perspectives.",SPRINGERNATURE,2023 OCT 12,,,10.1007/s40889-023-00179-5,7

We first blend pre-trained models for photo and artwork generation, resulting in a series of mixed models. Subsequently, we utilize these mixed models to generate images exhibiting varying degrees of artness with pseudo-annotations. Each photorealistic image has a corresponding artistic counterpart and a series of interpolated images that range from realistic to artistic. This dataset is then employed to train a neural network that learns to estimate quantized artness levels of arbitrary images.

We provide an introduction as well as an overview of such techniques, specifically illustrating their use with single-cell gene expression data. For example, the low dimensional latent representations offered by various approaches, such as variational auto-encoders, are useful to get a better understanding of the relations between observed gene expressions and experimental factors or phenotypes. Furthermore, by providing a generative model for the latent and observed variables, deep generative models can generate synthetic observations, which allow us to assess the uncertainty in the learned representations. While deep generative models are useful to learn the structure of high-dimensional omics data by efficiently capturing non-linear dependencies between genes, they are sometimes difficult to interpret due to their neural network building blocks. More precisely, to understand the relationship between learned latent variables and observed variables, e.g., gene transcript abundances and external phenotypes, is difficult. Therefore, we also illustrate current approaches that allow us to infer the relationship between learned latent variables and observed variables as well as external phenotypes.

Addressing this, we propose the first end-to-end autoregressive generative model that generates tokenized limit order book (LOB) messages.

To handle long sequences efficiently, the model employs simplified structured state-space layers to process sequences of order book states and tokenized messages. Using LOBSTER data of NASDAQ equity LOBs, we develop a custom tokenizer for message data, converting groups of successive digits to tokens, similar to tokenization in large language models. Out-of-sample results show promising performance in approximating the data distribution, as evidenced by low model perplexity. Furthermore, the mid-price returns calculated from the generated order flow exhibit a significant correlation with the data, indicating impressive conditional forecast performance.

The latter include assessment procedures, information accuracy, and skill devaluation. As many complex technologies, generative pre-trained transformers are ambivalent in nature, providing a great potential for learning and education at large, including new approaches based on critical thinking and awareness of the pros and cons of AI. ChatGPT in science: great prospects for text generation and improvements in language quality adjoin to dubious authorship and potentially inconsistent and erroneous parts in the AI-produced texts. Publishers and journals are working out new publishing policies, including publishing ethics towards AI-assisted or AI-improved submissions. Conclusion: JLE is planning to revise its editorial policy to address the new challenges from AI technologies. JLE editors welcome new submissions of research articles and reviews as well as special issues on ChatGPT and related themes, with potential applications of chatbots in education, innovative approaches to writing assignments, facilitating personalized learning, academic integrity issues related to AI-supported writing, etc. in focus.",NATL RESEARCH UNIV HIGHER SCH ECONOMICS,,9,3,10.17323/jle.2023.18119,7
"Essa, A",The Future of Postsecondary Education in the Age of AI,artificial intelligence; adult learners; adaptive learning; generative AI; learning analytics,"This paper examines a possible future for postsecondary education in the age of AI. The consensus view among economists is that AI is a general purpose technology (GPT), similar to the steam engine, electricity, and the internet. As a GPT, AI will be the main driver of innovation for the foreseeable future in most sectors of the economy, including education. As AI evolves, it holds the promise of fundamentally redefining the educational landscape, influencing not only current practices in institutional management and pedagogy but also shaping future trends in learning, evaluation, and accreditation. While traditional college-aged students have received significant attention in educational studies, this paper emphasizes the needs of adult learners as lifelong learners and explores how AI-driven innovations can enhance their educational experiences, offering personalized and flexible learning solutions. This paper also argues that a dramatic breakthrough is needed in the cost-value equation for education to support workforce development and lifelong learning.",MDPI,MAR,14,3,10.3390/educsci14030326,15

This study empirically explores the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT, specifically its portrayal of environmental justice issues. Using OpenAI's ChatGPT API, we asked ChatGPT (GPT-4) to answer questions about environmental justice issues in 3,108 counties in the contiguous United States. Our findings suggest that ChatGPT provides a general overview of environmental justice issues. Consistent with research, ChatGPT appears to acknowledge the disproportionate distribution of environmental pollutants and toxic materials in low-income communities and those inhabited by people of color. However, our results also highlighted ChatGPT's shortcomings in detailing specific local environmental justice issues, particularly in disadvantaged (e.g., rural and low-income) counties. For instance, ChatGPT could not provide information on local-specific environmental justice issues for 2,593 of 3,108 counties (83%). The results of the binary logistic regression model revealed that counties with lower population densities, higher percentages of white population, and lower incomes are less likely to receive local-specific responses from the ChatGPT. This could indicate a potential regional disparity in the volume and quality of training data, hinting at geographical biases.

However, GANs are considered 'black boxes'. Specifcally, the end-users have little control over how to improve editing directions through disentanglement. Prior work focused on new GAN architectures to disentangle editing directions. Alternatively, we propose GAN(RAVEL-a) user-driven direction disentanglement tool that complements the existing GAN architectures and allows users to improve editing directions iteratively. In two user studies with 16 participants each, GAN(RAVEL) users were able to disentangle directions and outperformed the state-of-the-art direction discovery baselines in disentanglement performance.

Automation is key for fielding and defending software systems at scale. Researchers in Symbolic AI have had considerable success in finding flaws in human-created code. Also, run-time testing methods such as fuzzing do uncover numerous bugs. However, the major deficiency of both approaches is the inability of the methods to fix the discovered errors. They also do not scale and defy automation. Static analysis methods also suffer from the false positive problem - an overwhelming number of reported flaws are not real bugs. This brings up an interesting conundrum: Symbolic approaches actually have a detrimental impact on programmer productivity, and therefore do not necessarily contribute to improved code quality. What is needed is a combination of automation of code generation using large language models (LLMs), with scalable defect elimination methods using symbolic AI, to create an environment for the automated generation of defect-free code.",SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,,12542,,10.1117/12.2664116,6

University education needs to maintain its relevance in an AI-mediated world, but the higher education sector is only beginning to engage deeply with the implications of AI within society. We define AI according to a relational epistemology, where, in the context of a particular interaction, a computational artefact provides a judgement about an optimal course of action and that this judgement cannot be traced. Therefore, by definition, AI must always act as a 'black box'. Rather than seeking to explain 'black boxes', we argue that a pedagogy for an AI-mediated world involves learning to work with opaque, partial and ambiguous situations, which reflect the entangled relationships between people and technologies. Such a pedagogy asks learners locate AI as socially bounded, where AI is always understood within the contexts of its use.

In an online study (N=138), we collected a dataset of people interacting with a generative adversarial network (StyleGAN2) in an image reconstruction task. We found that more control dimensions (sliders) significantly increase task difficulty and user actions. Visual feedforward partly mitigates this by enabling more goal-directed interaction. However, we found no evidence of faster or more accurate task performance. This indicates a tradeoff between feedforward detail and implied cognitive costs, such as attention. Moreover, we found that visualizations alone are not always sufficient for users to understand individual control dimensions.

"Albarqawi, WA; Alburgawi, SA",Mapping the approaches for investigating Makkah's architectural vocabularies and AI: A literature review,Makkah; Architecture; Identity; AI; Generative,"Makkah has developed unique architectural vocabularies for centuries. The Roushan, Qalalib, Kharja, and Shwabir responded to topography, climate conditions, and socio-cultural aspects. However, demolishing heritage buildings to expand the Holy Mosque has led to the disappearance of many traditional architectural vocabularies. Then, the imposition of modern architectural elements by modernity increased a feeling of discontinuity with the past. In addition, globalization has branded Makkah as a city of skyscrapers and high-rise buildings. Megaprojects have emerged since Saudi Arabia announced its Vision 2030, necessitating creative architectural solutions. Although the literature on the architecture of Makkah introduced varied approaches to developing traditional architectural vocabularies, the results were far from anticipated. Most studies assumed that traditional elements should shape the future of architecture in Makkah. The field of architecture suggests analyzing physical forms in reality, while the philosophical attempt proposes exploring them in virtuality. Reality and virtuality must be dynamic in space as methods for innovation; this space should be detached from architecture to challenge physical norms and separated from philosophy to promote practicality. This paper maps the literature to evaluate the approaches that examine the architecture of Makkah. It suggests a third space, outside architecture, and philosophy, utilizing AI to generate Makkah's architectural elements. The aim is to employ technology, i.e., AI, not to document but to generate architectural vocabulary based on rising potentials and differentiations, which are the bases of innovation, hence establishing continuity with the past to shape the future.(c) 2023 Higher Education Press Limited Company.

AI technologies and the needs of data librarians are hybrid and symbiotic, because academic libraries must insert AI technologies into their information and data services. Library services need AI to interpret the context of big data. OBJECTIVES: In this context, we explore the use of the OpenAI Codex, a deep learning model trained on Python code from repositories, to generate code scripts for data librarians. This investigation examines the practices, models, and methodologies for obtaining code script insights from complex code environments linked to AI GPT technologies. METHODS: The proposed AI-powered method aims to assist data librarians in creating code scripts using Python libraries and plugins such as the integrated development environment PyCharm, with additional support from the Machinet AI and Bito AI plugins. The process involves collaboration between the data librarian and the AI agent, with the librarian providing a natural language description of the programming problem and the OpenAI Codex generating the solution code in Python.RESULTS: Five specific web-scraping problems are presented. The scripts demonstrate how to extract data, calculate metrics, and write the results to files. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study highlights the application of AI in assisting data librarians with code script creation for web scraping tasks. AI may be a valuable resource for data librarians dealing with big data challenges on the Web. The possibility of creating Python code with AI is of great value, as AI technologies can help data librarians work with various types of data sources.

Existing intrusion detection systems can effectively defend traditional network attacks, however, they face AI based threats. The current known AI attacks cannot balance the escape rate and attack effectiveness. In addition, the time cost of existing AI attacks is very high. In this paper, we propose a backdoor attack called VulnerGAN, which features high concealment, high aggressiveness, and high timeliness. The backdoor can make the specific attack traffic bypass the detection of ML-NIDS without affecting the performance of ML-NIDS in identifying other attack traffic. VulnerGAN uses generative adversarial networks (GAN) to calculate poisoning and adversarial samples based on machine learning model vulnerabilities. It can make traditional network attack traffic escape black-box online ML-NIDS. At the same time, model extraction and fuzzing test are used to enhance the convergence of VulnerGAN. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the VulnerGAN backdoor attack increases 33.28% in concealment, 18.48% in aggressiveness, and 46.32% in timeliness.",SCIENCE PRESS,JUL,65,7,10.1007/s11432-021-3455-1,19

Some have argued that this necessitates augmenting machine intelligence with understanding such that, when queried, a machine is able to explain its behaviour (i.e., explainable AI). In this article, we address the issue of machine understanding from the perspective of active inference. This paradigm enables decision making based upon a model of how data are generated. The generative model contains those variables required to explain sensory data, and its inversion may be seen as an attempt to explain the causes of these data. Here we are interested in explanations of one's own actions. This implies a deep generative model that includes a model of the world, used to infer policies, and a higher-level model that attempts to predict which policies will be selected based upon a space of hypothetical (i.e., counterfactual) explanations-and which can subsequently be used to provide (retrospective) explanations about the policies pursued. We illustrate the construct validity of this notion of understanding in relation to human understanding by highlighting the similarities in computational architecture and the consequences of its dysfunction.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,NOV 5,15,,10.3389/fnsys.2021.772641,13

Until the introduction of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) in March 2023, these LLMs only contained a single mode-text. As medicine is a multimodal discipline, the potential future versions of LLMs that can handle multimodality-meaning that they could interpret and generate not only text but also images, videos, sound, and even comprehensive documents-can be conceptualized as a significant evolution in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper zooms in on the new potential of generative AI, a new form of AI that also includes tools such as LLMs, through the achievement of multimodal inputs of text, images, and speech on health care's future. We present several futuristic scenarios to illustrate the potential path forward as multimodal LLMs (M-LLMs) could represent the gateway between health care professionals and using AI for medical purposes. It is important to point out, though, that despite the unprecedented potential of generative AI in the form of M-LLMs, the human touch in medicine remains irreplaceable. AI should be seen as a tool that can augment health care professionals rather than replace them. It is also important to consider the human aspects of health care-empathy, understanding, and the doctor-patient relationship-when deploying AI.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",NOV 2,25,,10.2196/52865,8

Qualitative data analysis from a co-curricular creative writing programme, including reflections, surveys, and focus-group interviews, reveals emerging artificial intelligence literacies and students' improvisational aptitudes for interpreting, subverting, and transforming notions of authorship. Students decentred authorial attribution through the pragmatic adoption of the technology as a creative catalyst, negotiated creative conventions by adopting non-conventional communication strategies, and reconceptualised creativity as distributed across human and non-human agents. Our approach of student-driven learning for autonomous exploration, sense-making, and criticality with GenAI indicates the potential for promoting conditions for students to exercise intellectual equality and emancipation. The findings contribute to the understanding of authorship and creativity; begin to contour emerging GenAI literacies and competencies; and suggest that creative collaborations with GenAI may be a promising way to foster emancipatory practices in the classroom, while nurturing creative and critical skills.",ELSEVIER,FEB,102,,10.1016/j.poetic.2024.101865,12

While this technology has great potential to improve lives, it also leads to the emergence of DeepFake where synthesized speech can be misused to deceive humans and machines for nefarious purposes. In response to this evolving threat, there has been a significant amount of interest in mitigating this threat by DeepFake detection. Complementary to the existing work, we propose to take the preventative approach and introduce AntiFake, a defense mechanism that relies on adversarial examples to prevent unauthorized speech synthesis. To ensure the transferability to attackers' unknown synthesis models, an ensemble learning approach is adopted to improve the generalizability of the optimization process. To validate the efficacy of the proposed system, we evaluated AntiFake against five state-of-the-art synthesizers using real-world DeepFake speech samples.

Only images directly produced by cameras are deemed unaltered and beyond suspicion, as they have not undergone any modifications. However, there is a recent trend among camera manufacturers to integrate AI-based modules into the dedicated onboard hardware, specifically the image signal processor (ISP), responsible for processing the captured sensor image into the final saved image for users. Many of these AI modules utilize perceptual or generative losses during training, which can hallucinate image content. While this hallucinated content often manifests as small details and textures, there are instances where these regions unintentionally impact the interpretation of the entire image. This paper aims to bring attention to this issue and advocate for in-camera strategies to validate the authenticity of camera-captured images at a pixel level. We propose the creation of an authenticity mask that could be stored as additional metadata with each image. This information can be extracted and overlaid on the image to easily identify the hallucinated regions. Considering the widespread implications of image authenticity (e.g., in courtroom evidence, news broadcasts, and other media forms), we anticipate that authentication metadata will become a standard practice for any ISP utilizing AI.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,,12,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3381521,8

A lightweight generated sample quality evaluation (LGSQE) method is proposed in this work. LGSQE trains a binary classifier to differentiate real and synthetic images from a generative model and, then, uses it to assign a soft label between zero and one to a generated sample as its quality index. LGSQE can reject poor generations and serve as a post-processing module for quality control. Furthermore, by aggregating quality indices of a large number of generated samples, LGSQE offers four metrics (i.e., classification accuracy (Acc), the area under the curve (AUC), precision, and recall) to evaluate the performance of a generative model as a byproduct. LGSQE demands a significantly smaller memory size and faster evaluation time while preserving the same rank order predicted by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID).

Though public enthusiasm is booming, systematic auditing of potential gender biases in AI-generated images remains scarce. We addressed this gap by examining the prevalence of two occupational gender biases (representational and presentational biases) in 15,300 DALL center dot E 2 images spanning 153 occupations. We assessed potential bias amplification by benchmarking against the 2021 U.S. census data and Google Images. Our findings reveal that DALL center dot E 2 underrepresents women in male-dominated fields while overrepresenting them in female-dominated occupations. Additionally, DALL center dot E 2 images tend to depict more women than men with smiles and downward-pitching heads, particularly in female-dominated (versus male-dominated) occupations. Our algorithm auditing study demonstrates more pronounced representational and presentational biases in DALL center dot E 2 compared to Google Images and calls for feminist interventions to curtail the potential impacts of such biased AI-generated images on the media ecology. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools like DALL center dot E 2 are great at turning text into creative images. Despite the fact that many people are excited about adopting this technology, not much research has been done on gender biases in the images AI generates. Our study looked at this issue by examining over 15,000 images created by DALL center dot E 2 that depict people in 153 different jobs. We compared these AI-generated images with job data from the 2021 U.S. census and pictures found on Google Images. We found that DALL center dot E 2 often underrepresents women in jobs where men are more common but overrepresents them in jobs where women are more common. Additionally, the AI tends to show more women than men with smiling faces and heads tilted down, particularly in jobs where women are more common. This could lead to misconceptions about women's roles and abilities in these occupations. Our research found that these biases in DALL center dot E 2 images are more severe than those in Google Images. This highlights the need for efforts to reduce gender biases in AI so that we will not reinforce gender stereotypes and ensure fair representation of both women and men in AI-generated images.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,NOV 8,29,1,10.1093/jcmc/zmad045,15

Recent applications and research suggest that AI can not only influence but also accelerate innovation in organizations. However, as the field is rapidly growing, a common understanding of the underlying theoretical capabilities has become increasingly vague and fraught with ambiguity. In view of the centrality of innovation capabilities in making innovation happen, we bring together these scattered perspectives in a systematic and multidisciplinary literature review. The aim of this literature review is to summarize the role of AI in influencing innovation capabilities and provide a taxonomy of AI applications based on empirical studies. Drawing on the technological-organizational-environmental (TOE) framework, our review condenses the research findings of 62 studies. The results of our study are twofold. First, we identify a dichotomous view of innovation capabilities triggered by AI adoption: enabling and enhancing. The enabling capabilities are those that research identifies as enablers of AI adoption, underscoring the competencies and routines needed to implement AI. The enhancing capabilities denote the role that AI adoption has in transforming or creating innovation capabilities in organizations. Second, we propose a taxonomy of AI applications that reflects the practical adoption of AI in relation to three underlying reasons: replace, reinforce, and reveal. Our study makes three main contributions. First, we identify the innovation capabilities that are either required for or generated by AI adoption. Second, we propose a taxonomy of AI applications.

"Hacker, P",The European AI liability directives - Critique of a half-hearted approach and lessons for the future,Artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; Product liability; EU law; AI act; Sustainability; Innovation; Large generative AI models,"The optimal liability framework for AI systems remains an unsolved problem across the globe. With ChatGPT and other large generative models taking the technology to the next level, solutions are urgently needed. In a much-anticipated move, the European Commis-sion advanced two proposals outlining the European approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive (AILD) and a revision of the Product Liability Directive (PLD). They constitute the final cornerstone of AI regulation in the EU. Crucially, the liability proposals and the proposed EU AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not con-tain any individual rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a Brussels effect in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and other countries.Against this background, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the liability proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction, they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and causality.Hence, second, the article suggests amendments to the proposed AI liability framework. They are collected in a concise Annex at the end of the paper. I argue, inter alia, that the dichotomy between the fault-based AILD Proposal and the supposedly strict liability PLD Proposal is fictional and should be abandoned; that an EU framework for AI liability should comprise one fully harmonizing regulation instead of two insufficiently coordinated direc-tives; and that the current proposals unjustifiably collapse fundamental distinctions be-tween social and individual risk by equating high-risk AI systems in the AI Act with those under the liability framework.Third, based on an analysis of the key risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond. More specif-ically, I make four key proposals. Effective compensation should be ensured by combin-ing truly strict liability for certain high-risk AI systems with general presumptions of de-fectiveness, fault and causality in cases involving SMEs or non-high-risk AI systems. The paper introduces a novel distinction between illegitimate-and legitimate-harm models to delineate strict liability's scope. Truly strict liability should be reserved for high-risk AI sys-tems that, from a social perspective, should not cause harm (illegitimate-harm models, e.g., autonomous vehicles or medical AI). Models meant to cause some unavoidable harm by ranking and rejecting individuals (legitimate-harm models, e.g., credit scoring or insurance scoring) may merely face rebuttable presumptions of defectiveness and causality. General-purpose AI systems and Foundation Models should only be subjected to high-risk regulation, including liability for high-risk AI systems, in specific high-risk use cases for which they are deployed. Consumers, in turn, ought to be liable based on regular fault, in general.Furthermore, innovation and legal certainty should be fostered through a comprehen-sive regime of safe harbours, defined quantitatively to the best extent possible. Moreover, trustworthy AI remains an important goal for AI regulation. Hence, the liability framework must specifically extend to non-discrimination cases and provide for clear rules concerning explainability (XAI).Finally, awareness for the climate effects of AI, and digital technology more broadly, is rapidly growing in computer science. In diametrical opposition to this shift in discourse and understanding, however, EU legislators have long neglected environmental sustainabil-ity in both the draft AI Act and the proposed liability regime. To counter this, I propose to jump-start sustainable AI regulation via sustainability impact assessments in the AI Act and sustainable design defects in the liability regime. In this way, the law may help spur not only fair AI and XAI, but also sustainable AI (SAI).(c) 2023 Philipp Hacker. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to examine the feasibility of decarbonization of mega-scale industrial parks with two emerging technologies; first, an integrated energy system involving an air separation unit (ASU) and a liquid air energy storage (LAES)-based power generation system (ALPG) with the assistance of a large-scale liquified natural gas (LNG) plant and second, the green electricity predicted by various renewable energy (VRE) scenarios using an AI-driven generative model concerning techno-economic and environmental analyses. Firstly, the electricity demand of mega-scale petrochemical industrial complexes was allocated, and remote sensing data of VRE (wind and solar) were collected in South Korea. Then, the ALPG was modeled to consider the actual operation of an LNG plant near target complexes. Subsequently, the CC-informed VRE scenario generation model (CC-VRES) based on an adversarial autoencoder (AAE) algorithm was developed to generate VRE scenarios considering the CC effects. Finally, techno-economic and environmental assessments were conducted to target the mega-DIP by 2050. The results showed that the levelized cost of electricity of the proposed ALPG was 150 $/MWh, which is enough to supply the required sustainable electricity, considering the Korean energy plan and CC effects in the CC-VRES model. Therefore, the excess VRE can be used to decarbonize the target industrial parks; it is anticipated that 26,084 GW h/yr of renewable and sustainable electricity will be generated and cover the total electricity demand of Yeosu and Ulsan target complexes while reducing 13,943-kilo t CO2 eq./yr through 2050.",PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,JAN,189,,10.1016/j.rser.2023.113933,23

In this work, we focus on explainable AI and propose a novel generic and model-agnostic framework for synthesizing input exemplars that maximize a desired response from a machine learning model. To this end, we use a generative model, which acts as a prior for generating data, and traverse its latent space using a novel evolutionary strategy with momentum updates. Our framework is generic because (i) it can employ any underlying generator, e.g.. Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and (ii) it can be applied to any input data, e.g. images, text samples or tabular data. Since we use a zero-order optimization method, our framework is model-agnostic, in the sense that the machine learning model that we aim to explain is a black-box. We stress out that our novel framework does not require access or knowledge of the internal structure or the training data of the black-box model. We conduct experiments with two generative models, VAEs and GANs, and synthesize exemplars for various data formats, image, text and tabular, demonstrating that our framework is generic. We also employ our prototype synthetization framework on various black-box models, for which we only know the input and the output formats, showing that it is model-agnostic.

However, there are many scenarios that call for a more general AI, capable of solving a wide array of tasks without being specifically designed for them. The term General Purpose Artificial Intelligence Systems (GPAIS) has been defined to refer to these AI systems. To date, the possibility of an Artificial General Intelligence, powerful enough to perform any intellectual task as if it were human, or even improve it, has remained an aspiration, fiction, and considered a risk for our society. Whilst we might still be far from achieving that, GPAIS is a reality and sitting at the forefront of AI research. This work discusses existing definitions for GPAIS and proposes a new definition that allows for a gradual differentiation among types of GPAIS according to their properties and limitations. We distinguish between closed-world and open-world GPAIS, characterising their degree of autonomy and ability based on several factors such as adaptation to new tasks, competence in domains not intentionally trained for, ability to learn from few data, or proactive acknowledgement of their own limitations. We then propose a taxonomy of approaches to realise GPAIS, describing research trends such as the use of AI techniques to improve another AI (commonly referred to as AI-powered AI) or (single) foundation models. As a prime example, we delve into generative AI (GenAI), aligning them with the terms and concepts presented in the taxonomy. Similarly, we explore the challenges and prospects of multi-modality, which involves fusing various types of data sources to expand the capabilities of GPAIS. Through the proposed definition and taxonomy, our aim is to facilitate research collaboration across different areas that are tackling general purpose tasks, as they share many common aspects. Finally, with the goal of providing a holistic view of GPAIS, we discuss the current state of GPAIS, its prospects, implications for our society, and the need for regulation and governance of GPAIS to ensure their responsible and trustworthy development.",ELSEVIER,MAR,103,,10.1016/j.inffus.2023.102135,16

The wide range of topics covered in these news articles further compounds the difficulties for investors. The diverse content adds complexity and uncertainty to the text, making it arduous for very short-term investors to swiftly and accurately extract valuable insights. Variations between authors, media sources, and cultural backgrounds also introduce additional complexities. Hence, performing a bull-bear semantic analysis of financial news using text mining technologies can alleviate the volume, time, and energy pressures on very short-term investors, while enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of their investment decisions. This study proposes labeling bull-bear words using a futures corpus detection method that extracts valuable information from financial news, allowing investors to quickly understand market trends. Generative AI models are trained to provide real-time bull-bear advice, aiding investors in adapting to market changes and devising effective trading strategies. Experimental results show the effectiveness of various models, with random forest and SVMs achieving an impressive 80% accuracy rate. MLP and deep learning models also perform well. By leveraging these models, the study reduces the time spent reading financial articles, enabling faster decision making and increasing the likelihood of investment success.

However, recent advances in generative AI have marked an inflection point in this narrative, including for scientific writing. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the capabilities and limitations of six AI chatbots in scholarly writing in the humanities and archaeology. The methodology was based on tagging AI-generated content for quantitative accuracy and qualitative precision by human experts. Quantitative accuracy assessed the factual correctness in a manner similar to grading students, while qualitative precision gauged the scientific contribution similar to reviewing a scientific article. In the quantitative test, ChatGPT-4 scored near the passing grade (-5) whereas ChatGPT-3.5 (-18), Bing (-21) and Bard (-31) were not far behind. Claude 2 (-75) and Aria (-80) scored much lower. In the qualitative test, all AI chatbots, but especially ChatGPT-4, demonstrated proficiency in recombining existing knowledge, but all failed to generate original scientific content. As a side note, our results suggest that with ChatGPT-4, the size of large language models has reached a plateau. Furthermore, this paper underscores the intricate and recursive nature of human research. This process of transforming raw data into refined knowledge is computationally irreducible, highlighting the challenges AI chatbots face in emulating human originality in scientific writing. Our results apply to the state of affairs in the third quarter of 2023. In conclusion, while large language models have revolutionised content generation, their ability to produce original scientific contributions in the humanities remains limited.

The IF-THEN rules can be expressed in a way that is easily understandable for humans, such as IF A THEN B. The generative model then visualizes the state as patterns that is easy for humans to comprehend.

Most of the solutions proposed in the literature are based on filtering or masking out these regions as an additional processing step. There has been little investigation into explicitly learning robustness to such artefacts with single-step end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose an augmentation technique (CycleSTTN) that adds temporally consistent and realistic specularities to endoscopic videos. Such videos can act as ground truth data with known texture occluded behind the added specularities.

Discovering optimal and safe coil implementations (for EV and road) is challenging because of the combinatorial explosion of possible configurations, along with multiple conflicting objective functions, such as maximizing the output power, while minimizing stray magnetic fields and the volume of windings and magnetic cores. To solve the problem, a differentiable simulator and evaluator define loss functions that train a generative neural network to only produce configurations that satisfy eight given design criteria. Before training, the rate of finding successful designs is 0.005%, but within 500 training epochs, the rate becomes 98% (about 30 seconds run time).

As such, influencer marketing is perceived as an effective and cost-effective marketing tool. However, like all areas of marketing there are broad-based shifts that are having significant effects on the domain of influencer marketing. First, there are calls for greater levels of diversity and broader representation of diverse communities. Second, digital innovation is having a profound effect on the field of influencer marketing, leading to the advent of virtual influencers that are artificially created, often through generative AI. These shifts raise questions about the effect of diversity in influencer marketing - with implications for brands that engage virtual influencers. In this paper, we present two experiments that investigate the effect of diversity representation in the context of virtual influencers. Results show that when brands engage virtual influencers to represent diverse subgroups, novelty and likeability act to mediate positive effects for the influencer (word-of-mouth and follow intentions) and the brand (purchase intentions).

Every robot that interacts with humans is an individual physical presence that may require their own personality. Thus, robot personalities engineers face a problem that is the reverse of that of personality psychologists: robot personalities engineers need to make batches of identical robots into individual personalities, as oppose to formulating comprehensive yet parsimonious descriptions of individual personalities that already exist. The robot personality research so far has been fruitful in demonstrating the positive effects of robot personality but unfruitful in insights into how robot personalities can be engineered in significant quantities. To engineer robot personalities for mass-produced robots we need a generative personality model with a structure to encode a robot's individual characteristics as personality traits and generate behaviour with inter- and intra-individual differences that reflect those characteristics.

To date, dominant approaches to AI ethics have traditionally focused on the agency of the organisations creating such AI projects (e.g. the Google AI principles), but more recent approaches focus on wider structures and frameworks that may potentially support responsible AI design (e.g. the Ethically Aligned Design framework by IEEE). In this paper, we argue that such frameworks are both incomplete and insufficient as these approaches give primacy to either agency or structure. Moreover, in both approaches, the emancipation of those for whom AI is designed is almost completely ignored. To remove these lacunae, we suggest an emancipatory approach to AI ethics based on the key tenets of the philosophy and ontology of critical realism. The stratified ontology of critical realism suggests that structural conditions may be modified to activate the mechanisms supporting any desired outcome (e.g., bias-free AI). In addition, such an emancipatory approach works towards activating the mechanisms supporting the reflexivity of the stakeholders in any specific AI context.

Within this paper, we present a remedy to this challenge through the application of prompt editing. Furthermore, our experimental results substantiate that our proposed solution more effectively preserves contextual coherence among the generated images in comparison to other preexisting generative artificial intelligence models.

A potential solution is to use image prompts alongside text prompts to condition the model. To better understand how and when image prompts can improve subject representation in generations, we conduct an annotation experiment to quantify their effect on generations of abstract, concrete plural, and concrete singular subjects. We find that initial images improved subject representation across all subject types, with the most noticeable improvement in concrete singular subjects.

We replicate three experiments in the psychology literature quantifying sexual objectification and show that the phenomena persist in trained AI models. A first experiment uses standardized images of women from the Sexual OBjectification and EMotion Database, and finds that human characteristics are disassociated from images of objectified women: the model's recognition of emotional state is mediated by whether the subject is fully or partially clothed. Embedding association tests (EATs) return significant effect sizes for both anger (d > 0.80) and sadness (d > 0.50), associating images of fully clothed subjects with emotions. GRAD-CAM saliency maps highlight that CLIP gets distracted from emotional expressions in objectified images where subjects are partially clothed. A second experiment measures the effect in a representative application: an automatic image captioner (Antarctic Captions) includes words denoting emotion less than 50% as often for images of partially clothed women than for images of fully clothed women. A third experiment finds that images of female professionals (scientists, doctors, executives) are likely to be associated with sexual descriptions relative to images of male professionals. A fourth experiment shows that a prompt of a [age] year old girl generates sexualized images (as determined by an NSFW classifier) up to 73% of the time for VQGAN-CLIP (age 17), and up to 42% of the time for Stable Diffusion (ages 14 and 18); the corresponding rate for boys never surpasses 9%.

This methodology harnesses a suite of indicators to establish a Robustness Assurance Quotient (RAQ) tailored to address environmentally noisy data while maintaining parity with current standards, namely the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) metric. While the FID metric successfully indicates the closeness of highly structured data, it is less successful measuring closeness of inherently noisy data. A score for ascertaining the closeness between Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-simulated, inherently noisy radiofrequnecy data and original GAN signals are proposed by focusing on the subject and context of the image.

Specifically, we aim to assess whether ChatGPT can demonstrate clinical decision-making equivalent to that of expert nurses and novice nursing students. This will be evaluated by comparing ChatGPT responses to clinical scenarios to those of nurses on different levels of experience. Design: This is a cross-sectional study. Methods: Emergency room registered nurses (i.e. experts; n = 30) and nursing students (i.e. novices; n = 38) were recruited during March-April 2023. Clinical decision-making was measured using three validated clinical scenarios involving an initial assessment and reevaluation. Clinical decision-making aspects assessed were the accuracy of initial assessments, the appropriateness of recommended tests and resource use and the capacity to reevaluate decisions. Performance was also compared by timing response generations and word counts. Expert nurses and novice students completed online questionnaires (via Qualtrics), while ChatGPT responses were obtained from OpenAI. Results: Concerning aspects of clinical decision-making and compared to novices and experts: (1) ChatGPT exhibited indecisiveness in initial assessments; (2) ChatGPT tended to suggest unnecessary diagnostic tests; (3) When new information required re-evaluation, ChatGPT responses demonstrated inaccurate understanding and inappropriate modifications. In terms of performance, the mean number of words utilized in ChatGPT answers was 27-41 times greater than that utilized by both experts and novices; and responses were provided approximately 4 times faster than those of novices and twice faster than expert nurses. ChatGPT responses maintained logical structure and clarity. Conclusions: A generative AI tool demonstrated indecisiveness and a tendency towards over-triage compared to human clinicians. Impact: The study shows that it is important to approach the implementation of ChatGPT as a nurse's digital assistant with caution. More study is needed to optimize the model's training and algorithms to provide accurate healthcare support that aids clinical decision-making.

This task is underscored by the Generative Learning Trilemma, which posits that it is not possible for any image synthesis model to simultaneously excel at high-quality sampling, achieve mode convergence with diverse sample representation, and perform rapid sampling. In this paper, we explore the potential of Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) for image synthesis, leveraging the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer. We undertake a comprehensive performance assessment of QBMs in comparison to established generative models in the field: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). Our evaluation is grounded in widely recognized scoring metrics, including the Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Kernel Inception Distance (KID), and Inception Scores. The results of our study indicate that QBMs do not significantly outperform the conventional models in terms of the three evaluative criteria. Moreover, QBMs have not demonstrated the capability to overcome the challenges outlined in the Trilemma of Generative Learning.

Visualizing Journalistic Roles through AI,Journalistic representation; metajournalistic discourse; artificial intelligence; AI; visual representation; generative art; algorithmic art; synthetic media,"The question of who is a journalist? has animated much discussion in journalism scholarship. Such discussions generally stem from the intersecting technological, economic, and social transformations journalism has faced in the twenty-first century. An equally relevant aspect, albeit one that has hitherto been less studied, is what a journalist looks like. Some studies have tackled this through, for example, examining depictions of journalists in popular culture, but artificial intelligence understandings of what a journalist is and what they look like have yet to receive research attention. While AI-enabled generative art has existed since the late 1990s, the ease and accessibility of these processes has greatly been boosted by providers like Midjourney which emerged since the 2020s and allow those without programming skills to easily create algorithmic images from text prompts. This study analyzes 84 images generated by AI from four generic keywords (journalist, reporter, correspondent, and the press) and three specialized ones (news analyst, news commentator, and fact-checker) over a six-month period.

The training dataset is assumed to be unavailable. This task differs from the standard XAI (explainable AI) scenario, since we wish to explain the anomalous deviation from a black-box prediction rather than the black-box model itself. We begin by showing that mainstream model-agnostic explanation methods, such as the Shapley values, are not suitable for this task because of their deviation-agnostic property. We then propose a novel framework for probabilistic anomaly attribution that allows us to not only compute attribution scores as the predictive mean but also quantify the uncertainty of those scores. This is done by considering a generative process for perturbations that counter-factually bring the observed anomalous observation back to normalcy. We introduce a variational Bayes algorithm for deriving the distributions of per variable attribution scores. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first probabilistic anomaly attribution framework that is free from being deviation-agnostic.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,,,,10.1145/3580305.3599365,12

The available pharmacometric methods have limited capacity for modeling the inter-relationships and patterns of variability among physiological determinants of drug dosing (PDODD). To investigate whether generative adversarial networks (GANs) can learn a generative model from real-world data that recapitulates PDODD distributions. A GAN architecture was developed for modeling a PDODD panel comprised of: age, sex, race/ethnicity, body weight, body surface area, total body fat, lean body weight, albumin concentration, glomerular filtration rate (EGFR), urine flow rate, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, alanine aminotransferase to alkaline phosphatase R-value, total bilirubin, active hepatitis B infection status, active hepatitis C infection status, red blood cell, white blood cell, and platelet counts. The panel variables were derived from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data sets. The dependence of GAN-generated PDODD on age, race, and active hepatitis infections was assessed. The continuous PDODD biomarkers had diverse non-normal univariate distributions and bivariate trend patterns. The univariate distributions of PDODD biomarkers from GAN simulations satisfactorily approximated those in test data. The joint distribution of the continuous variables was visualized using three 2-dimensional projection methods; for all three methods, the points from the GAN simulation random variate vectors were well dispersed amongst the test data. The age dependence trend patterns in GAN data were similar to those in test data. The histograms for R-values and EGFR from GAN simulations overlapped extensively with test data histograms for the Hispanic, White, African American, and Other race/ethnicity groups.

"Abrishami, S; Goulding, J; Rahimian, F",Generative BIM workspace for AEC conceptual design automation: prototype development,Generative design; Genetic algorithm; Space syntax; AI; Conceptual design,"Purpose The integration and automation of the whole design and implementation process have become a pivotal factor in construction projects. Problems of process integration, particularly at the conceptual design stage, often manifest through a number of significant areas, from design representation, cognition and translation to process fragmentation and loss of design integrity. Whilst building information modelling (BIM) applications can be used to support design automation, particularly through the modelling, amendment and management stages, they do not explicitly provide whole design integration. This is a significant challenge. However, advances in generative design now offer significant potential for enhancing the design experience to mitigate this challenge. Design/methodology/approach The approach outlined in this paper specifically addresses BIM deficiencies at the conceptual design stage, where the core drivers and indicators of BIM and generative design are identified and mapped into a generative BIM (G-BIM) framework and subsequently embedded into a G-BIM prototype. This actively engages generative design methods into a single dynamic BIM environment to support the early conceptual design process. The developed prototype followed the CIFE horseshoe methodology of aligning theoretical research with scientific methods to procure architecture, construction and engineering (AEC)-based solutions. This G-BIM prototype was also tested and validated through a focus group workshop engaging five AEC domain experts. Findings The G-BIM prototype presents a valuable set of rubrics to support the conceptual design stage using generative design. It benefits from the advanced features of BIM tools in relation to illustration and collaboration (coupled with BIM's parametric change management features). Research limitations/implications This prototype has been evaluated through multiple projects and scenarios. However, additional test data is needed to further improve system veracity using conventional and non-standard real-life design settings (and contexts). This will be reported in later works. Originality/value Originality and value rest with addressing the shortcomings of previous research on automation during the design process.

In response, a rich literature across computer science, law, and ethics is rapidly proliferating to advance approaches to designing fair algorithms. Yet computer scientists, legal scholars, and ethicists are often not speaking the same language when using the term 'bias.' Debates concerning whether society can or should tackle the problem of algorithmic bias are hampered by conflations of various understandings of bias, ranging from neutral deviations from a standard to morally problematic instances of injustice due to prejudice, discrimination, and disparate treatment. This terminological confusion impedes efforts to address clear cases of discrimination. In this paper, we examine the promises and challenges of different approaches to disambiguating bias and designing for justice. While both approaches aid in understanding and addressing clear algorithmic harms, we argue that they also risk being leveraged in ways that ultimately deflect accountability from those building and deploying these systems.

However, adversarial attacks can be used to perturb images so as to evade detection by these models. This study investigates the effectiveness of training deep learning models with Generative Adversarial Network-generated data to improve their robustness against such attacks. Two image conversion methods, byteplot and space-filling curves, were used to represent the malware samples, and a ResNet-50 architecture was used to train models on the image datasets. The models were then tested against a projected gradient descent attack. It was found that without GAN-generated data, the models' prediction performance drastically decreased from 93-95% to 4.5% accuracy. However, the addition of adversarial images to the training data almost doubled the accuracy of the models. This study highlights the potential benefits of incorporating GAN-generated data in the training of deep learning models to improve their robustness against adversarial attacks.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,,,,10.1145/3590777.3590792,8
"McGuire, ES; Tomuro, N",What Can You Do with a Sword? Gender Biases in Text Game Affordances,gender bias; generative ai; text games,"Game mechanics can be viewed in terms of affordances: possible actions offered by the environment-depending on the agent (e.g., in a fantasy role-playing game, a sword can be wielded by a knight, but probably not by a dragon). Recently, text generated by large language models (LLMs) has been used to create open-ended text-based game content. However, LLMs have been shown to generate sexist text when trained on gender-biased data. If bias manifests in educational text game affordances it could harm goal achievement. We examine binary gender biases in LIGHT, an English-language persona-based dataset for researching language grounded in a fantasy adventure world, training LLMs on LIGHT and analyzing the diversity of affordances in quests. We find male characters have a more diverse space of affordances yet are less diverse in practice (e.g., mostly wielding a sword) in original and generated quests. To gauge impact on gameplay, we create games from LIGHT quests which can be played in the TextWorld research framework. Artificial agents trained only on male games significantly outperform female, suggesting an impact of affordance biases. These findings illustrate risks in AI- or data-driven generation of serious game content where gender is involved: overlooked biases in affordances can propagate, autonomously enforcing harmful, stereotypical behaviors.",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,,14475,,10.1007/978-3-031-49065-1_48,6

The proposed GAN-based architecture efficiently provides accurate footstep planning design for TurtleBot4 on the ROS (Robot Operating System) platform. The designed robot's perception of its surroundings allows it to generate a precise path for navigation during travel. Even though various algorithms, such as A* and RRT* (rapidly exploring random tree), are often employed to plan the path, they need more efficiency in confined spaces. However, deep learning approaches such as GANs have shown remarkable results in solving real-world issues such as image generation and simulation of difficult scenarios in robotics. This article proposes a mechanism to design the GAN algorithm for path generation, thus facilitating the efficient navigation of wheeled robots in complex environments such as narrow streets. According to the experiments, the approach based on GAN works better than traditional algorithms such as heuristic Q-Learning and A*. In comparison to the actual path, it is discovered that the generated path using the path planner based on GAN is approximately 94% accurate.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,2024 JAN 14,,,10.1007/s12008-023-01721-x,12

We propose a model where incumbents have an initial advantage in ML technology and access to (historical) operational data. We show that the increased application of ML for operational data raises entrepreneurial barriers that make the creative destruction process less destructive (less business stealing) if entrepreneurs have only limited access to the incumbent's data. However, this situation induces entrepreneurs to take on more risk and to be more creative. Policies making data generally available may therefore be suboptimal. A complementary policy is one that supports entrepreneurs' access to ML, such as open source initiatives, since doing so would stimulate creative entrepreneurship. Why generative AI and big data may make the creative destruction process not only more creative but also less destructive. We show that entrepreneurs should consider that challenging incumbents in the era of ML and big data will be more difficult since incumbents' use of ML for proprietary data makes them more formidable competitors. This fact implies that entrepreneurs need to become riskier and more creative in the future to find a competitive edge. They may therefore seek support from venture capital to become more novel in their ventures. Data protection and privacy issues became a flashpoint in the media due in part to the high-profile exposure of Facebook users' data to Cambridge Analytica in 2016 and 2017. The rapidly expanding adoption of generative AI is seen as a risk of locking in the market dominance of large incumbent technology firms. Partially in response to these events, government regulators have instituted tighter rules on data protection. The results derived in this paper suggest that a complementary policy might be to support entrepreneurs' access to and knowledge of ML technology since doing so would stimulate creative entrepreneurship.",SPRINGER,2023 NOV 16,,,10.1007/s11187-023-00829-4,29

To address this issue, we propose a medical image-fusion model based on knowledge distillation (KD) and an explainable AI module-based generative adversarial network with dual discriminators (KDE-GAN).

ChatGPT is a newer form of AI-based large language model that can generate complex texts that are almost indistinguishable from human-generated text. It has already garnered substantial interest from people due to its potential utility in a variety of contexts. The current study was conducted to evaluate the utility of ChatGPT in generating accurate, clear, concise, and unbiased information that could support a scientific research process. To achieve this purpose, we initiated queries on both versions of ChatGPT regarding digital school leadership and teachers' technology integration, two significant topics currently discussed in educational literature, under four categories: (1) the definition of digital leadership, (2) the digital leadership skills of school principals, (3) the factors affecting teachers' technology integration, and (4) the impact of digital leadership on teachers' technology integration. Next, we performed a comparative analysis of the responses generated by ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4. The results showed that both versions were capable of providing satisfactory information compatible with the relevant literature. However, ChatGPT-4 provided more comprehensive and categorical information as compared to ChatGPT-3.5, which produced responses that were more superficial and short-cut. Although the results are promising in aiding the research process with AI-based technologies, we should also caution that, in their current form, these tools are still in their infancy, and there is a long way to go before they become fully capable of supporting scientific work. Meanwhile, it is significant that researchers continue to develop the relevant knowledge base to support the responsible, safe, and ethical integration of these technologies into the process of scientific knowledge creation, as Pandora's box has already been opened, releasing newer opportunities and risks to be tackled.",MDPI,JUL,13,7,10.3390/admsci13070157,19

Using only simple input prompts, it is possible to generate novel text, images, video, music, and source code, as well as tackle tasks such as answering questions and translating and summarising text. However, the potential for these models to impact computing education practice is only just beginning to be explored. For example, novices learning to code can now use free tools that automatically suggest solutions to programming exercises and assignments; yet these tools were not designed with novices in mind and little to nothing is known about how they will impact learning. Furthermore, much attention has focused on the immediate challenges these models present, such as academic integrity concerns. It seems that even in the AI-era a pending apocalypse sells better than a promising renaissance. Generative AI will likely play an increasing role in people's lives in the reasonably foreseeable future. Model performance seems set to continue accelerating while novel uses and new possibilities multiply. Given this, we should devote just as much effort to identifying and exploiting new opportunities as we do to identifying and mitigating challenges. In this talk, we begin by discussing several concrete and researchbacked opportunities for computing educators. Many of these have already shown great promise in positively impacting current practice.

The survey of academics' perceptions encompasses considerations of academic integrity, transferrable skills, and ethical GAI use. The responses unveiled a range of significant findings regarding the present condition of essay-based assessment in Economics education. The most prominent of which is that, while GAI development has introduced a new conflict between integrity concerns and essay-writing, Economics academics confirm that the latter continues to be important to their graduates. However, there is an emphasis on reshaping the format of conventional essays and refining traditional marking criteria. Elevating assessment questions along Bloom's taxonomy is deemed vital for critical thinking and producing futureready graduates. Respondents also recognise the need to impart ethical awareness among students when using GAI while exploring innovative pedagogies to develop and assess the new GAI skill set. Thus, our study challenges the dichotomy of pulling the plug on conventional essays and, instead, prompts a critical re-evaluation-resuscitation through reimagination. Finally, most express interest in learning more about GAI and its educational applications, either through selfexperimentation or structured events and GAI training.

A number of GAN variants for this purpose have been proposed; however, evaluating GAN performance is inherently difficult because current methods for measuring the quality of their output are not always consistent with what a human perceives. We propose a novel approach that combines a brain-computer interface (BCI) with GANs to generate a measure we call Neuroscore, which closely mirrors the behavioral ground truth measured from participants tasked with discerning real from synthetic images. This technique we call a neuro-AI interface, as it provides an interface between a human's neural systems and an AI process. In this paper, we first compare the three most widely used metrics in the literature for evaluating GANs in terms of visual quality and compare their outputs with human judgments. Secondly, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach using neural signals and rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) that directly measures a human perceptual response to facial production quality, independent of a behavioral response measurement. The correlation between our proposed Neuroscore and human perceptual judgments has Pearson correlation statistics: r(48) = - 0.767, p = 2.089e - 10. We also present the bootstrap result for the correlation i.e., p <= 0.0001. Results show that our Neuroscore is more consistent with human judgment compared with the conventional metrics we evaluated. We conclude that neural signals have potential applications for high-quality, rapid evaluation of GANs in the context of visual image synthesis.",SPRINGER,JAN,12,1,10.1007/s12559-019-09670-y,12

We then apply each examined LLM to generate news content with headlines of these news articles as prompts, and evaluate the gender and racial biases of the AIGC produced by the LLM by comparing the AIGC and the original news articles. We further analyze the gender bias of each LLM under biased prompts by adding gender-biased messages to prompts constructed from these news headlines. Our study reveals that the AIGC produced by each examined LLM demonstrates substantial gender and racial biases.

This study aims to explore the factors that shape the academic community's desire and intention to use AI conversational chatbot technology, with a particular focus on the leading ChatGPT.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a mixed method approach to explore the educators' adoption of chatbots through an empirically validated model. The model, known as the Educators' Adoption of ChatGPT, was developed by integrating the theoretical foundations of both the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and Status Quo Bias (SQB) frameworks, as well as insights gathered from interviews. The relationships within this model were then tested using a quantitative approach. The partial least squares-structural equation modelling method was used to analyse 243 valid survey responses.FindingsThe outcomes of the analysis indicated that perceived educators' effort expectancy, educators' autonomous motivation, perceived learners' AI competency, perceived educators' competency, innovative behaviour towards technological agility and perceived students' engagement are significant determinants of educators' intention to use chatbots. In contrast, perceived unfair evaluation of students, perceived students' overreliance and perceived bias/inaccuracies were shown to have significant impacts on the resistance to use the technology, which typically implies a negatively significant influence on the educators' use intention. Interestingly, perceived fraudulent use of ChatGPT was proven insignificant on the resistance to use chatbots.Originality/valueThis study makes a significant contribution to the field of educational technology by filling the gap in research on the use and acceptance of AI-enabled assistants in education. It proposes an original, empirically validated model of educator adoption, which identifies the factors that influence educators' willingness to use chatbots in higher education and offers valuable insights for practical implementation.",EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,2023 DEC 21,,,10.1108/ITSE-07-2023-0127,36

This work investigates the capabilities of fine-tuned text-to-text transfer Transformer (T5) models for commonsense reasoning and explanation generation. Our experiments suggest that while self-rationalizing models achieve interesting results, a significant gap remains: classifiers consistently outperformed self-rationalizing models, and a substantial fraction of model-generated explanations are not valid.

Largely driven by large language models (LLMs), many tools are now able to interpret and generate both natural language instructions and source code. These capabilities have sparked urgent questions in the computing education community around how educators should adapt their pedagogy to address the challenges and to leverage the opportunities presented by this new technology. In this working group report, we undertake a comprehensive exploration of generative AI in the context of computing education and make five significant contributions. First, we provide a detailed review of the literature on LLMs in computing education and synthesise findings from 71 primary articles, nearly 80% of which have been published in the first 8 months of 2023. Second, we report the findings of a survey of computing students and instructors from across 20 countries, capturing prevailing attitudes towards GenAI/LLMs and their use in computing education contexts. Third, to understand how pedagogy is already changing, we offer insights collected from in-depth interviews with 22 computing educators from five continents. Fourth, we use the ACM Code of Ethics to frame a discussion of ethical issues raised by the use of large language models in computing education, and we provide concrete advice for policy makers, educators, and students. Finally, we benchmark the performance of several current GenAI models/tools on various computing education datasets, and highlight the extent to which the capabilities of current models are rapidly improving. There is little doubt that LLMs and other forms of GenAI will have a profound impact on computing education over the coming years. However, just as the technology will continue to improve, so will our collective knowledge about how to leverage these new models and tools in educational settings. We expect many important conversations around this topic will emerge as the community explores how to provide more effective, inclusive, and personalised learning experiences.

Initially, a synthetic dataset is generated that mirrors the ten classes of the already available CIFAR-10 dataset with latent diffusion, providing a contrasting set of images for comparison to real photographs. The model is capable of generating complex visual attributes, such as photorealistic reflections in water. The two sets of data present as a binary classification problem with regard to whether the photograph is real or generated by AI.

Image superresolution helps in industrial image enhancement, classification, detection, pattern recognition, surveillance, satellite imaging, medical diagnosis, image analytics, etc. It is of utmost importance to keep the features of the low-resolution image intact while enlarging and enhancing it. In this research paper, a framework is proposed that works in three phases and generates superresolution images while keeping low-resolution image features intact and reducing image blurring and artifacts. In the first phase, image enlargement is done, which enlarges the low-resolution image to the 2x/4x scale using two standard algorithms. The second phase enhances the image using an AI-empowered Generative adversarial network (GAN). We have used a GAN with dual generators and named it EffN-GAN (EfficientNet-GAN). Fusion is done in the last phase, wherein the final improved image is generated by fusing the enlarged image and GAN output image. The fusion phase helps in reducing the artifacts. We have used the DIV2K dataset to train the GAN and further tested the results on the images of Set5, Set14, B100, Urban100, Manga109 datasets with ground truth of size 224x224x3.

This article explores an unsupervised feature learning method for machinery health monitoring by proposing a generative adversarial networks (GAN) model that exploits the merits of the autoencoder and the traditional GAN. The major contribution is that the data distribution of the normal samples is accurately learned by the GAN model within both the signal spectrum and latent representation spaces. Specifically, the discriminative feature for machinery health monitoring is learned in an unsupervised manner by the proposed method in three steps. First, the proposed GAN model is trained by the normal samples of the inspected machine with the aim to correctly reconstruct the signal spectrum and its latent representation. Then, the trained model is applied to test the online samples of the same machine with unknown health conditions. Finally, the dissimilarity between the tested samples and their reconstructed ones in the latent representation space is taken as the discriminative feature. The feature value will increase significantly if a fault occurs in the inspected machine because the abnormal samples are never trained in the proposed GAN model.

Several IT companies have developed and possess AI-based garment design technologies that utilize StyleGAN2 for image transformation. However, they are not widely utilized in the fashion business. Since fashion brands need to create numerous designs to launch new garment products for at least two seasons per year, the adoption of AI-based garment design generation technology can be one way to increase work efficiency. Therefore, this research aims to collect and analyze existing cases of AI-based garment design tools in order to identify the similarities and differences between the garment development processes of human designers and the existing AI-based garment design tools. Based on this analysis, the research aims to develop an AI-based garment development system that takes into consideration the garment development process of human designers, incorporating fashion domain knowledge.",SPRINGER,OCT 25,10,1,10.1186/s40691-023-00360-w,17
"Myers, KL; Wilkins, DE",Reasoning about locations in theory and practice,locational reasoning; belief revision; generative planning; hierarchical task networks; experimental AI,"Locational reasoning plays an important role in many applications of Al problem-solving systems, yet has remained a relatively unexplored area of research. This paper addresses both theoretical and practical issues relevant to reasoning about locations. We define several theories of location designed for use in various settings, along with a sound and complete belief revision calculus for each that maintains a STRIPS-style database of locational facts. Techniques for the efficient operationalization of the belief revision rules in planning frameworks are presented. These techniques were developed during application of the location theories to several large-scale planning tasks within the SIPE-2 planning framework.",BLACKWELL PUBLISHERS,MAY,14,2,10.1111/0824-7935.00059,37

However, when it comes to applying these findings within a urological context, there have not been many studies. Thus, our objective was rooted in analyzing the pros and cons of ChatGPT use and how it can be exploited and used by urologists.Recent findingsChatGPT can facilitate clinical documentation and note-taking, patient communication and support, medical education, and research. In urology, it was proven that ChatGPT has the potential as a virtual healthcare aide for benign prostatic hyperplasia, an educational and prevention tool on prostate cancer, educational support for urological residents, and as an assistant in writing urological papers and academic work. However, several concerns about its exploitation are presented, such as lack of web crawling, risk of accidental plagiarism, and concerns about patients-data privacy.SummaryThe existing limitations mediate the need for further improvement of ChatGPT, such as ensuring the privacy of patient data and expanding the learning dataset to include medical databases, and developing guidance on its appropriate use. Urologists can also help by conducting studies to determine the effectiveness of ChatGPT in urology in clinical scenarios and nosologies other than those previously listed.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,SEP 7,10,,10.3389/fsurg.2023.1257191,8

Developing angles from a document such as a press release is a cognitively taxing process, in which journalists critically examine the implicit meaning of its claims. Informed by interviews with journalists, we developed AngleKindling, an interactive tool which employs the common sense reasoning of large language models to help journalists explore angles for reporting on a press release. In a study with 12 professional journalists, we show that participants found AngleKindling significantly more helpful and less mentally demanding to use for brainstorming ideas, compared to a prior journalistic angle ideation tool. AngleKindling helped journalists deeply engage with the press release and recognize angles that were useful for multiple types of stories. From our findings, we discuss how to help journalists customize and identify promising angles, and extending AngleKindling to other knowledge-work domains.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,,,,10.1145/3544548.3580907,16

In this exploratory study, several synthetic datasets are generated using various configurations of a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from a set of 156 observations related to adult hearing screening. A rule-based native XAI algorithm, the Logic Learning Machine, is used in combination with conventional utility metrics. The classification performance in different conditions is assessed: models trained and tested on synthetic data, models trained on synthetic data and tested on real data, and models trained on real data and tested on synthetic data. The rules extracted from real and synthetic data are then compared using a rule similarity metric. The results indicate that XAI may be used to assess the quality of synthetic data by (i) the analysis of classification performance and (ii) the analysis of the rules extracted on real and synthetic data (number, covering, structure, cut-off values, and similarity). These results suggest that XAI can be used in an original way to assess synthetic health data and extract knowledge about the mechanisms underlying the generated data.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,AUG,27,8,10.1109/JBHI.2023.3236722,10

To solve this challenging multi-modal image translation problem, we propose a novel Photo-reAlistic fashIon desigN synThesis (PAINT) framework, which decomposes the framework into three manageable stages. In the first stage, we employ a Layout Generative Network (LGN) to transform an input human pose into a series of person semantic layouts. In the second stage, we propose a Texture Synthesis Network (TSN) to synthesize textures on all transformed semantic layouts. Specifically, we design a novel attentive texture transfer mechanism for precisely expanding texture patches to the irregular clothing regions of the target fashion designs. In the third stage, we leverage an Appearance Flow Network (AFN) to generate the fashion design images of other viewpoints from a single-view observation by learning 2D multi-scale appearance flow fields. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating diverse photo-realistic multi-view fashion design images with fine-grained appearance details conditioned on the provided multiple inputs.

"Tarp, S; Nomdedeu-Rull, A",Who has the last word? Lessons from using ChatGPT to develop an AI-based Spanish writing assistant,Spanish writing assistants; language didactics; generative AI chatbots; training of language model; human-assisted intelligence,"This article deals with the complex relationship between human intelligence and so-called artificial intelligence in the context of an ongoing project to develop a writing assistant for Spanish learners, both native and non-native. The authors have used ChatGPT to generate validation data to assess the performance of the language model on different parameters before testing it with real users. The article describes how they approached the generation of validation data, what they learned along the way, and what the results were. It first introduces the project and describes its main phases. It then explains the criteria the authors used to determine the types of problems to be covered by the validation data, and how they instructed the chatbot to generate this data. Finally, it summarises the main lessons they learnt from working with the chatbot and some of the challenges they faced in getting it to work properly. The description is accompanied by numerous examples. By engaging with the chatbot in a critical and constructive way, and by establishing close interdisciplinary collaboration with IT specialists, the authors conclude that the key challenge is to demonstrate in practice that humans, not the chatbot, are the masters. In this context, they argue that generative AI language models are not here to replace us, but to help us produce faster and with higher quality to meet our growing and increasingly diverse demands for a better life.","UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, SERVICIO PUBLICACIONES",,,97,10.5209/clac.91985,13
